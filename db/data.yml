    - Mrs. Frisby, a widowed mouse with four small children, is faced with a terrible
      problem. She must move her family to their summer quarters immediately, or face
      almost certain death. But her youngest son, Timothy, lies ill with pneumonia
      and must not be moved. Fortunately, she encounters the rats of NIMH, an extraordinary
      breed of highly intelligent creatures, who come up with a brilliant solution
      to her dilemma. And Mrs. Frisby in turn renders them a great service.

    - From Emilie Coulter's Amazon.com Review
    - This unusual novel, winner of the Newbery Medal (among a host of other accolades)
      snags the reader on page one and reels in steadily all the way through to the
      exhilarating conclusion. Robert O'Brien has created a small but complete world
      in which a mother's concern for her son overpowers her fear of all her natural
      enemies and allows her to make some extraordinary discoveries along the way.
      O'Brien's incredible tale, along with Zena Bernstein's appealing ink drawings,
      ensures that readers will never again look at alley rats and field mice in the
      same way.

    - ! 'This short novel is a study of grief--chiefly, that felt by Summer after
      her foster mother''s sudden death, but also her sorrow at witnessing the grief
      of Ob, her foster father--she realizes that she herself may not be reason enough
      for him to go on living. And for several months it seems as if he may not in
      fact go on, until Summer and Ob take a short car trip that somehow transforms
      their lives. In a direct, matter-of-fact voice occasionally laced with irony
      and wry humor, Summer articulates many discerning insights about sorrow and
      loss. The reader remains a distant observer of her emotions, however--perhaps
      because the novel begins after May''s death, making her a less immediate figure,
      perhaps because Summer''s perceptions are quite sophisticated, even adult. And
      the novel''s emotional turning point is difficult to grasp, either verbally
      or intuitively: all Summer, and we, know is that "something happened to Ob"
      to make him embrace life fully again. '

    - ! 'A gifted writer returns to one of her favorite themes--love- -in this case,
      as it can inform and transform grief. After her mother''s death, Summer was
      handed from one unwilling relative to another, ``treated like a homework assignment
      somebody was always having to do.'''' At six, she was taken in by an elderly
      uncle and aunt. Ob had a game leg (WW II) and enjoyed creating unusual whirligigs;
      May liked gardening behind their West Virginia trailer. They loved each other
      with a deep and abiding love, wholeheartedly including Summer. Now, six years
      later, May has died. In a poetic, ruminative narrative, Summer recounts Ob''s
      mounting depression, his growing conviction that May is still present, and their
      expedition to find ``Miriam B. Conklin: Small Medium at Large.'''' Meanwhile,
      they''ve been befriended by Cletus, an odd, bright boy in Summer''s class; she
      doesn''t especially value his company, but is intrigued by his vocabulary (``surreal'''';
      ``Renaissance Man'''') and his offhand characterization of her as a writer.
      The quest seems to fail- -Reverend Conklin has died--but on the way home Ob
      finally puts aside his grief to take the two young people to the state capitol
      as promised: ``Right out of the blue, he wanted to live again.'''' Rylant reveals
      a great deal about her four characters, deftly dropping telling details from
      the past into her quiet story--including a glimpse of Summer, as seen by a girl
      in her class, ``like some sad welfare case,'''' a description the reader who
      has read her thoughts will know to be gloriously untrue. A beautifully written,
      life-affirming book.'

    - MacLachlan.. has written an affecting tale for children. In the late 19th century
      a widowed midwestern farmer with two children--Anna and Caleb--advertises for
      a wife. When Sarah arrives she is homesick for Maine, especially for the ocean
      which she misses greatly. The children fear that she will not stay, and when
      she goes off to town alone, young Caleb--whose mother died during childbirth--is
      stricken with the fear that she has gone for good. But she returns with colored
      pencils to illustrate for them the beauty of Maine, and to explain that, though
      she misses her home, "the truth of it is I would miss you more." The tale gently
      explores themes of abandonment, loss and love.

    - In this laugh-out-loud novel, a young teen on the fast track to the juvenile
      detention center suddenly finds himself living in rural North Carolina with
      the outrageously eccentric Applewhite clan. Jake Semple, 13, has been expelled
      from a long line of schools before coming to the Applewhites to be homeschooled.
      This extended family forms what a visiting reporter christens an "artistic dynasty,"
      with various creative endeavors absorbing the adults' time and attention. Jake
      is left largely to his own devices, since the family doesn't believe in telling
      their charges what or when to study. He develops a loyal following consisting
      of an active four-year-old and an overweight basset hound, and his transformation
      is complete once he becomes enmeshed in the family's production of The Sound
      of Music. Quirky characters, from the cub reporter to the visiting guru, add
      to the offbeat humor. The Applewhites' over-the-top personalities mark them
      as literary kin of Helen Cresswell's Bagthorpes. Running beneath the narrative
      that gently pokes fun at everything from sculpture to TV documentaries, though,
      is also the story of a boy allowing himself to belong and begin to discover
      his own potential. This has terrific booktalk and read-aloud potential, and
      will help fill the need for humorous contemporary fiction.

    - ! "Every kid thinks about running away at one point or another; few get farther
      than the end of the block. Young Sam Gribley gets to the end of the block and
      keeps going--all the way to the Catskill Mountains of upstate New York. There
      he sets up house in a huge hollowed-out tree, with a falcon and a weasel for
      companions and his wits as his tool for survival. In a spellbinding, touching,
      funny account, Sam learns to live off the land, and grows up a little in the
      process. Blizzards, hunters, loneliness, and fear all battle to drive Sam back
      to city life. But his desire for freedom, independence, and adventure is stronger.
      No reader will be immune to the compulsion to go right out and start whittling
      fishhooks and befriending raccoons.\r\nJean Craighead George, author of more
      than 80 children's books, including the Newbery Medal-winning Julie of the Wolves,
      created another prizewinner with My Side of the Mountain--a Newbery Honor Book,
      an ALA Notable Book, and a Hans Christian Andersen Award Honor Book. Astonishingly,
      she wrote its sequel, On the Far Side of the Mountain, 30 years later, and a
      decade after that penned the final book in the trilogy, Frightful's Mountain,
      told from the falcon's point of view. George has no doubt shaped generations
      of young readers with her outdoor adventures of the mind and spirit."

    - In a world with no poverty, no crime, no sickness and no unemployment, and where
      every family is happy, 12-year-old Jonas is chosen to be the community's Receiver
      of Memories. Under the tutelage of the Elders and an old man known as the Giver,
      he discovers the disturbing truth about his utopian world and struggles against
      the weight of its hypocrisy. With echoes of Brave New World, in this 1994 Newbery
      Medal winner, Lowry examines the idea that people might freely choose to give
      up their humanity in order to create a more stable society. Gradually Jonas
      learns just how costly this ordered and pain-free society can be, and boldly
      decides he cannot pay the price.

    - In a complete departure from her other novels, Lowry has written an intriguing
      story set in a society that is uniformly run by a Committee of Elders. Twelve-year-old
      Jonas's confidence in his comfortable "normal" existence as a member of this
      well-ordered community is shaken when he is assigned his life's work as the
      Receiver. The Giver, who passes on to Jonas the burden of being the holder for
      the community of all memory "back and back and back," teaches him the cost of
      living in an environment that is "without color, pain, or past." The tension
      leading up to the Ceremony, in which children are promoted not to another grade
      but to another stage in their life, and the drama and responsibility of the
      sessions with The Giver are gripping. The final flight for survival is as riveting
      as it is inevitable. The author makes real abstract concepts, such as the meaning
      of a life in which there are virtually no choices to be made and no experiences
      with deep feelings. This tightly plotted story and its believable characters
      will stay with readers for a long time.

      1939 movie, the original novel and its many sequels have enchanted both young
      and old over the years. Published for the centennial, several new books commemorate

    - Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and its sequel, Charlie and the Great Glass
      Elevator, along with Roald Dahl's other tales for younger readers, make him
      a true star of children's literature. Dahl seems to know just how far to go
      with his oddball fantasies; in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, for example,
      nasty Violet Beauregarde blows up into a blueberry from sneaking forbidden chewing
      gum, and bratty Augustus Gloop is carried away on the river of chocolate he
      wouldn't resist. In fact, all manner of disasters can happen to the most obnoxiously
      deserving of children because Dahl portrays each incident with such resourcefulness
      and humor.

      childhood justice and revenge, and as much candy as you can eat. The book is
      also available in Spanish (Charlie y la Fabrica de Chocolate). (The suggested
      age range for this book is 9-12, but nobody this reviewer has met can resist
      it, including New York City bellhops, flight attendants, and grumpy teenagers.)

      Charlotte, who lives in the rafters above his pen. A prancing, playful bloke,
      Wilbur is devastated when he learns of the destiny that befalls all those of
      porcine persuasion. Determined to save her friend, Charlotte spins a web that
      reads "Some Pig," convincing the farmer and surrounding community that Wilbur
      is no ordinary animal and should be saved. In this story of friendship, hardship,
      and the passing on into time, E.B. White reminds us to open our eyes to the
      wonder and miracle often found in the simplest of things.

    - Figuring she'll never get adopted because of her caramel-colored skin and crippled
      leg, Rocky finds herself chosen by Emma and Fred, a kind, indulgent, alcoholic
      couple from Bolton, Kansas. It's in Bolton that she finds her devoted dog, Python,
      who leads her to Mick, the rumpled artist hired to design a monument to the
      town's war dead and the person who changes Rocky's view of life, art, and the
      world. Through the drawings he makes in order to get a feel for the town's people
      and history, the citizens of Bolton see themselves and their surroundings in
      a new light, although they're not sure they like it. As Mick does with his sketches,
      Paulsen tells the story in quick, deft strokes. The gossip at the grain elevator
      on a summer day, Rocky's insecurities and toughness, and the varied characters
      are vividly yet succinctly conveyed. In just three days, Mick breezes into town,
      turns Rocky on to the power of art, and convinces the people of Bolton that
      a grove of trees will be an appropriate monument as well as an artistic statement.
      Avoiding a lot of artistic jargon, Paulsen carries readers along with his (and
      Mick's) strong images and enthusiasm. A powerful, affecting story with its comments
      on art and homage. --Susan Knorr, Milwaukee Public Library

    - his unusual book provides an insider's look at the life of Birdy, 14, the daughter
      of a minor English nobleman. The year is 1290 and the vehicle for storytelling
      is the girl's witty, irreverent diary. She looks with a clear and critical eye
      upon the world around her, telling of the people she knows and of the daily
      events in her small manor house. Much of Birdy's energy is consumed by avoiding
      the various suitors her father chooses for her to marry. She sends them all
      packing with assorted ruses until she is almost wed to an older, unattractive
      man she refers to as Shaggy Beard. In the process of telling the routines of
      her young life, Birdy lays before readers a feast of details about medieval
      England. The book is rich with information about the food, dress, religious
      beliefs, manners, health, medical practices, and sanitary habits (or lack thereof)
      of the people of her day. From the number of fleas she kills in an evening to
      her herbal medicines laced with urine, Birdy reveals fascinating facts about
      her time period. A feminist far ahead of her time, she is both believable and
      lovable. A somewhat philosophical afterword discusses the mind set of medieval
      people and concludes with a list of books to consult for further information
      about the period. Superb historical fiction.

    - This powerful novel deals with a difficult yet important topic-rape. Melinda
      is just starting high school. It should be one of the greatest times in her
      life, but instead of enjoying herself, she is an outcast. She has been marked
      as the girl who called the police to break up the big end-of-the-summer party,
      and all the kids are angry at her. Even her closest friends have pulled away.
      No one knows why she made the call, and even Melinda can't really articulate
      what happened. As the school year goes on, her grades plummet and she withdraws
      into herself to the point that she's barely speaking. Her only refuge is her
      art class, where she learns to find ways to express some of her feelings. As
      her freshman year comes to an end, Melinda finally comes to terms with what
      happened to her-she was raped at that party by an upperclassman who is still
      taunting her at school. When he tries again, she finds her voice, and her classmates
      realize the truth. The healing process will take time, but Melinda no longer
      has to deal with it alone. Anderson expresses the emotions and the struggles
      of teenagers perfectly. Melinda's pain is palpable, and readers will totally
      empathize with her. This is a compelling book, with sharp, crisp writing that
      draws readers in, engulfing them in the story.

    - ! "Reading award-winning author Madeleine L'Engle's Meet the Austins is like
      taking a vacation with the warm, compassionate Austins--an extraordinary family
      who takes a little girl named Maggy Hamilton under its wing when her father
      is killed in a plane accident. Adjusting to a new household member is not easy,
      as the 12-year-old narrator, Vicky, will testify. Maggy is spoiled, \"ubiquitous,\"
      laughs in a \"horrid, screechy way,\" and appears to be a child of an entirely
      different species from the thoughtful, intelligent, kind, yet not cloyingly
      so, Austin kids. Still, Vicky and her other siblings (Rob, Suzy, and John) grit
      their collective teeth and struggle to understand her, which becomes easier
      and easier as the loving family seems to rub off on the newly orphaned Maggy.\r\nThe
      Austins are beyond question a charming family, but their path is by no means
      rock-free: Vicky sneaks off to a friend's house and severely injures herself
      in a bike accident, they all get the measles, John is beat up after his guest
      sermon in church, and they almost lose little Rob. Despite ordinary family setbacks,
      there's no use pretending this is a run-of-the-mill family. When Vicky is sick,
      her older brother, John, comes into her room and soothes her with a discussion
      of the solar system, our atomic composition, and the relativity of size. Family
      dinner-table talk includes the ethics of meat eating, and a chat with Grandfather
      ends up with a discussion of whether Einstein believed in God. As in all of
      L'Engle's novels, she asks the big questions: What is the meaning of life, and
      how does death fit into that? Are there different kinds of intelligence? What
      happens when you remove a screw from a radiator? This strangely comforting novel,
      first published in 1960, is an ALA Notable Book, and was followed by four other
      books featuring the Austin Family: The Moon by Night, The Young Unicorns, A
      Ring of Endless Light (a Newbery Honor Book), and Troubling a Star-Karin Snelson"

      angry, no one is as exciting as Tony. But when Tony suggests they climb the
      bluffs at Starved Rock, Joel is frightened, knowing how dangerous the bluffs
      are. He''s also afraid of Tony''s sharp tongue, though, so he asks his father
      for permission to ride his bike to Starved Rock, certain that his father will

      to go swimming at the pool with Joel, decides to swim in the river instead.

    - Twelve-year-old Joel has unwillingly agreed to bike out to the state park with
      his daredevil friend Tony. "On his honor," he promises his father to be careful,
      knowing that Tony wants them to climb the dangerous park bluffs. When they arrive,
      however, Tony abruptly changes his mind and heads for the river. With his promise
      jangling in his mind, Joel follows Tony in for a swim. Tony drowns in the dirty,
      turbulent water, leaving Joel to face his guilty conscience, and his father,
      alone. In this short but solid novel, Bauer effectively portrays the dilemma
      of pre-adolescents, old enough to want to meet their own challenges without
      adult interference, young enough to want grownup protection and reassurance.
      Joel understands only too well the moral dilemma he faces, but he is so bound
      by peer pressure that wrong choices and tragedy are almost inevitable. Bauer's
      association of Joel's guilt with the smell of the polluted river on his skin
      is particularly noteworthy. Its miasma almost rises off the pages. Descriptions
      are vivid, characterization and dialogue natural, and the style taut but unforced.
      A powerful, moving book.

    - Beverly Cleary's delightful peek into a young girl's life will capture a new
      audience. Listeners will giggle at third-grader Ellen's trials with both woolen
      underwear and her nemesis, Otis Spofford. They will sympathize with Ellen's
      desire to clap erasers, and her travails in acquiring a giant beet. Then there's
      the whole concept of being a substitute rat. Through it all, Ellen's friendship
      with Austine, and their quarrel and eventual reconciliation provide the thread
      that ties all the events together-–Teresa Bateman

    - ! 'Second grade is not turning out the way it should for Ramona Quimby. Her
      dad has lost his job, her mom has found a full-time job, and her big sister
      Beezus has "reached a difficult age." In her inimitable way, Ramona decides
      to take charge. She practices TV commercials in hopes of earning a million dollars,
      but only ends up insulting her teacher and getting into a prickly mess with
      some burrs. Then she embarks on a campaign to make her father stop smoking.
      Mr. Quimby manages to hold up under all these strains, but the challenge is
      on for the whole family to prove their mettle. '

    - ! "From the first day of third grade, when Ramona Quimby meets her eventual
      nemesis Yard Ape, life moves on at its usual wild pace--usual for the boisterous
      Ramona, that is. Soon she is accidentally squashing a raw egg into her hair
      at the school cafeteria, being forced to play Uncle Rat with her annoying young
      neighbor, and, worst of all, throwing up in her classroom. The responsibilities
      of an 8-year-old are sometimes daunting, especially in a family that is trying
      to squeak by while the father goes back to school. But Ramona is full of too
      much vim and vigor to ever be down for long.\r\n\r\nIn her second Newbery Honor
      Book about Ramona (the first was Ramona and Her Father), Beverly Cleary presents
      another slice of the Quimby family life. Author of more than two dozen children's
      books, Cleary has a true knack for understanding the tangle of thoughts and
      emotions in a child's mind and heart. Empathic, witty, and astute, she has earned
      many other awards, including the Newbery Medal for Dear Mr. Henshaw. Alan Tiegreen's
      clever line drawings have charmed countless readers of Cleary's books over the
      years, and his style is now inextricably tied to hers.--Emilie Coulter "

    - The engaging tale of young Ramona Quimby's first days in kindergarten, Ramona
      the Pest takes a pint-sized perspective on the trials and delights of beginning
      school. Ramona can't wait to learn all the important things. But she's disappointed
      when her teacher can't fill in missing parts of story lines, such as how Mike
      Mulligan went to the bathroom while digging the basement of the town hall. Nonetheless,
      Ramona loves her teacher, and loves going to school in spite of the torments--having
      to wear hand-me-down boots, for example, or having to (sometimes) suppress the
      urge to pull on another girl's "boing-boing" curls. Ramona's energetic take
      on life appeals to children who have passed through this stage, or who are dealing
      with a kindergarten-age sibling who is exhibiting Ramona-ish tendencies.--Richard

      landed on his feet. He belongs to the Brickers-a young couple who dote on him.
      Then a baby arrives in the household and Socks discovers that the people he'd
      trained so well no longer consider him the center of their universe. This is
      devastating, but eventually he finds a new place that everyone can be happy
      with. This is an hilarious book by Beverly Cleary, told from the cat's point
      of view, and Neil Patrick Harris does a slam-bang job of presenting it. Readers
      feel a kinship with Socks and root for his success, even while acknowledging
      his foibles. Both children and adults with roar with laughter at Sock's antics
      and cringe at his misdeeds.--Teresa Bateman

    - Roles are changed when young Prince Brat, as everyone calls him (he is so altogether
      rotten that "Not even black cats would cross his path"), runs away with Jemmy,
      his whipping boy (the commoner who takes the Prince's punishments). Because
      Brat has never learned to write and Jemmy can, a couple of prince-nappers decide
      that Jemmy is the real prince. Chiefly through Jemmy's cleverness, the two escape
      and return to court. Brat has learned much and changed for the better during
      his adventures. He winds up calling Jemmy "friend," and he is certain to be
      a better prince hereafter.

    - With his flair for persuading readers to believe in the ridiculous, Fleischman
      scores a hit with his new creation. Sis's skillful pictures emphasize events
      in the adventures of the orphan Jemmy, kept in his king's palace to be thrashed
      for the offenses committed by the royal heir, known as Prince Brat. It is forbidden
      to punish Brat, whose tricks multiply until Jemmy is tempted to escape the daily
      round of flogging. But the prince himself takes off and forces the whipping
      boy to go with him. As they get into and out of trouble on the outside, Jemmy
      hears that he has been accused of abducting Brat. When the prince arranges for
      their return to the palace, poor Jemmy fears the worst, but things turn out
      for the best at the story's satisfying close. Colorful types like a thief called
      Hold-Your-Nose Billy, Betsy and her dancing bear Petunia, et al., increase the
      fun.

    - Identical in format and length to its predecessor, Catwings , this new book
      picks up where that one left off. The four winged catsThelma, Roger, Harriet
      and Jamesare content in the country barn where they live, secretly cared for
      by humans Hank and Susan. But they would like to see their mother, and the dumpster
      where they were born. Only James and Harriet make the trip, and learn that the
      slums are being destroyed by demolition crews. Their mother and the dumpster
      have moved; instead, they find a winged kitten. After a brief reunion with their
      mother, who now lives amidst flower pots on an apartment roof, all three felines
      go to the farm. Some of this repeats the first book, such as the absence of
      a father, the mother who bravely, and perhaps somewhat curiously, sends the
      children away to a better life, and the rather dull goodness of the human boy
      and girl. Le Guin's graceful writingespecially of the adventurous rescue of
      the new member of the family and in the roof sceneis sweetly illuminated by
      Schindler's delicately tinted drawings.

    - James and Harriet, the youngest and most adventurous of four winged cats, return
      from the country refuge that they found in Catwings to the inner-city slum where
      they were born, to see their mother again. They find a frightened winged kitten
      before finding their mother, the genteel Mrs. Jane Tabby. She is delighted to
      see her grown children and grateful that they've brought back her lost kitten.
      She insists that they take the kitten to safety in the country. This may grate
      on those who criticized as unfeeling Mrs. Jane's decision, in the first book,
      to send her older children off to a new life so that she could begin a new liaison
      unfettered, but it seems in character. Although characterization is slight,
      there is enough to win readers' sympathy. This gently appealing story will mean
      more to those who enjoyed the more vigorous first book, but it is hard to resist
      a story that brings a terrified, lonely kitten home to a loving family. The
      illustrations are engaging pen-and-ink drawings with watercolor wash. A handsome
      little book for middle readers

      Ereth leave Dimwood Forest in search of Ragweed''s parents to tell them the
      sad news so that Poppy can "get on with her life." When they finally reach their
      destination, they discover it''s hardly the "dullsville" that Ragweed had described.
      In fact, his family has been forced to leave their comfortable nest and move
      to higher ground: a clan of development-mad beavers are flooding out the residents
      in their efforts to turn the pastoral backwater into "Canad''s Cute Condos."
      Along the way, Poppy encounters Ragweed''s dreamy, poetic brother Rye, and before
      long the two mice are head over paws in love. When a showdown between the scheming
      beavers and the reluctantly heroic mice puts Rye in danger, Poppy risks everything
      to save him. Of course, all''s well that ends well in this rollicking tale,
      which Avi infuses with generous helpings of adventure, romance and humor. He
      juggles multiple story lines effortlessly, and his characterizations are particularly
      engaging, from the blustering Caster P. Canad ("Bless my teeth and smooth my

    - Still grieving over the loss of her beau Ragweed of Poppy (1995), the intrepid
      deer mouse decides to bring the sad news to his family in this uneven, heavy-handed
      sequel. Setting out from Dimwood Forest with her hopelessly infatuated porcupine
      friend, Ereth, Poppy arrives just in time to help Ragweed's parents and numerous
      siblings avert eviction. Led by ruthless Caster P. Canad, a crew of beavers
      has dammed up the nearby brook in preparation for a housing project. The mice
      have already been flooded out of one home, and their new one is about to be
      threatened. Saddened--but also secretly relieved to be out from under his brother's
      shadow--dreamy Rye dashes out to see what he can do against the beavers, and
      is quickly captured. Having fallen in love with him at first sight, Poppy organizes
      a rescue, urging the meek mice to fight back; they do. The bad guys silently
      depart, and Poppy and Rye set a date. Avi develops his characters to a level
      of complexity that provides a distracting contrast with the simplistic story,
      an obvious take on human land-use disputes, and easily distinguishable victims
      and villains. In language more ugly than colorful, Ereth chews over his feelings
      for Poppy in several plot-stopping passages, and is last seen accompanying the
      happy couple back to Dimwood. Readers may wonder who to root for in this disappointing
      follow-up to one of the best animal stories in years.

      a clock-fixing tomboy running wild in the woods of Wisconsin. In 1864, this
      is a bit much for her Boston-bred mother to bear, but Caddie and her brothers
      are happy with the status quo. Written in 1935 about Carol Ryrie Brink''s grandmother''s
      childhood, the adventures of Caddie and her brothers are still exciting over
      60 years later. With each chapter comes another ever-more exciting adventure:
      a midnight gallop on her horse across a frozen river to warn her American Indian
      friends of the white men''s plan to attack; a prairie fire approaching the school
      house; and a letter from England that may change the family''s life forever.
      This Newbery Medal-winning book bursts at the seams with Caddie''s irrepressible
      spirit. In spite of her mother''s misgivings, Caddie is a perfect role model

      fly on homemade wings. His brother and sister are on the ground urging him on
      when Junior spots a police car coming up their road. Maggie and Vern run to
      hide in the woods, while Junior loses his grip on the roof and slides off, breaking
      both legs. The children's widowed mother is away working the rodeo circuit;
      Pap, their grandfather, has been arrested for disturbing the peace while he
      was, innocently enough, trying to retrieve the 2147 beer and pop cans that had
      spilled out of the back of his pick-up. Byars' characters are memorableespecially
      Vern, who manages to "break into" jail to be with Pap, thus causing a news sensation,
      and Ralphie, Junior's hospital roommate. The plot, however, is contrived in
      many ways. Readers are never told why police is "one of the most dreaded words
      in the family vocabulary," and credibility is stretched thin by Vern's jail
      break-in and by Maggie's and Ralphie's managing to wheel Juniorwith both legs
      in caststo Pap's hearing without being apprehended by hospital personnel. While
      this is not Byars' strongest book, the off-beat characters, crisp dialogue and
      fast-paced action will keep readers turning the pages.

    - Mr. Maxwell has taught fifth-grade science and supervised the class weeklong
      field trip to a nearby New Hampshire state park for many years. He is sure of
      his teaching methods and equally confident that his respect for nature is transmitted,
      a hundred students at a time, through the sessions in the woods. Mark Chelmsley,
      clearly bright, bored, and (in Mr. Maxwell's opinion) probably spoiled, moves
      to the small New Hampshire town just weeks before the trip. It's inevitable
      that the two clash. The third-person narrative alternates between the powerful
      adult and the lonely, stalwart boy, allowing readers to see both characters'
      strengths and weaknesses. At the end of the week in the woods, both boy and

    - Angered by his family's move from Scarsdale, NY, to rural New Hampshire, Mark
      refuses to make friends or please his teachers. Because of his indifference,
      one teacher decides that he's dealing with a "slacker" and a "spoiled rich kid."
      To make matters worse, the fifth grader acts unimpressed with Mr. Maxwell's
      annual outing to the state park for a week of nature studies. However, the boy
      becomes increasingly interested in the outdoors and camping and signs up for
      the trip. On the first day there, the teacher discovers Mark with a camping
      tool that contains a knife, an item that students were asked not to bring. He
      decides that someone needs to teach the boy a lesson and decides to send him
      home. Mark runs away, gets lost, and must use his newly acquired skills to survive
      a night in the woods. The story explores both Mark's and Mr. Maxwell's point
      of view, and the final resolution of their conflict is effective. The boy's
      relationships with his ever-absent parents and his caregivers are interestingly
      developed. The novel includes a helpful map of the state park. Like many of
      Clements's titles, this one will be a popular choice, particularly with fans
      of Gary Paulsen and Jean Craighead George.

    - Mark, the 11-year-old at the center of Clements's (Frindle; The Jacket) brooding
      and uneven novel, initially has no interest in making friends at his new school
      in Whitson, N.H., where his constantly traveling parents have just renovated
      and enlarged a 1798 farmhouse. Knowing that he's headed off to a prestigious
      boarding school next year, the boy has no incentive for pleasing his teachers
      and spends much of the day gazing out the classroom window. His science teacher,
      Mr. Maxwell, passes judgment on Mark before the boy finally decides to give
      the school a chance ("The only kind of people Mr. Maxwell disliked more than
      slackers were... buy-the-whole-world rich folks"). A showdown between boy and
      teacher occurs at the start of the annual environmental program organized by
      Mr. Maxwell for the fifth graders, who spend a week in a wooded state park.
      The teacher's discovery of Mark with a tool containing a knife (which actually
      belongs to another boy) climaxes with a pursuit through the woods. Unfortunately,
      the suspenseful sequence that follows and the engaging denouement account for
      only a fraction of the novel. Laborious passages about Mark's family's home
      and barn and the boy's preparations for the school trip, plus perhaps a bit
      too much description of Mr. Maxwell's background, bog down the story line and
      may derail readers drawn to the book's enticing title.

    - Life in the wilderness has just become a lot thornier for young Sam Gribley.
      For the last two years he's been living in a hollowed-out tree in the Catskill
      Mountains, hunting and gathering his food supply and befriending the critters
      in his "neighborhood." Sam's peaceful existence is abruptly shattered when an
      environmental conservation officer confiscates his peregrine falcon, Frightful.
      To make matters worse, Sam's sister Alice, who has been living with him for
      the past year, has disappeared. This double blow quickly puts Sam on the trail
      to the far side of his mountain, pursuing a multifaceted mystery that, ultimately,
      will force him to make the biggest decision of his life.

    - ! 'Fans of My Side of the Mountain will be delighted to find that Sam Gribley
      still lives in a hollow tree with Frightful, his faithful falcon. Sam has neighbors
      now: his sister Alice lives in a nearby treehouse and his old friend Bando has
      bought a nearby cabin. Sam''s summer plans are disrupted when a conservation
      officer accuses him of harboring an endangered species and confiscates Frightful.
      Sam is so devastated by the loss of his companion that several days pass before
      he realizes that Alice has left home. Setting out to track his sister down,
      Sam crosses paths with a band of falcon smugglers and is given the chance to
      take back Frightful for his own. Faced with a difficult decision, Sam chooses
      wisely and the story ends on a satisfying note, full of hope for the future.
      Since nature has become chic in the years since Sam''s first adventures were
      published, sophisticated readers will enjoy the author''s wry references to
      the new fashion for Adirondack furniture and her description of an eatery that
      specializes in gourmet wild foods. Filled with accurate details (it is possible
      to trace Sam''s journey on a map), likeable characters and plenty of backwoods
      lore, this sequel is worthy of its predecessor.'

    - More than 30 years later, the story of Sam Gribley is resumed shortly after
      it ended in My Side of the Mountain (Dutton, 1988) . When Frightful, the falcon,
      is confiscated and Sam's sister Alice disappears, Sam and his friend Bando look
      for her. In their search, they uncover a ring of illegal falcon dealers and
      come to terms with their limits and responsibilities as individual humans within
      the larger society of all mountain dwellers. Using a straightforward, first-person
      narrative and journal entries, George effectively evokes the natural setting
      with which she is obviously familiar. She also takes great care to describe
      the devices Sam and Alice construct to make their serene yet rugged life easier.
      These contraptions are complicated, but are clarified by black-and-white sketches.
      Sam remains the focus of the novel, but characters are abundant in contrast
      to his earlier solitary lifestyle. Unfortunately, they play mainly as a catalyst
      for Sam's actions and development. While their presence injects a note of reality,
      it also underscores the incredibility of the story, for the more contact Sam
      has with civilization, the more remarkable his living situation becomes. The
      plot is considerably more complicated than in the first book, and current issues
      are raised, but the timelessness of theme and setting is carried over from the
      original. The contrivance of the black-market bird dealer may serve as a device
      to engage readers' interest, but the strength of the story lies in Sam's personal
      observations and growth. This volume can be enjoyed without the background laid
      in the first book, and it will inspire many readers to investigate the beginning
      of Sam's story. --Starr LaTronica

      World War II. Lily makes up stories about her involvement with spies, submarines,
      and anti-Nazi plots in her small seaside town in 1944, but underlying her melodrama
      and lies is grief for her dead mother. When Lily''s father has to leave to fight
      in France, she is so hurt and furious that she refuses even to say good-bye
      to him. As she gets to know Albert, an orphaned Hungarian refugee, she learns
      about his secret anguish: he is guilt-stricken about the younger sister he left
      behind (he, also, didn''t say good-bye), and he is determined, somehow, to cross
      the ocean and find her. The happy ending, when Lily''s father finds Albert''s
      sister in France, is too contrived, but the reunion scenes at home are heartbreaking.
      The friendship story is beautifully drawn: both Lily and Albert are wary, reluctant,
      and needy; they quarrel as much as they bond, and in the end, they help each
      other to be brave. Hazel Rochman'

    - In her usual masterful way, Madeleine L'Engle jumps seamlessly from a child's
      world of liverwurst and cream cheese sandwiches to deeply sinister, cosmic battles
      between good and evil. Children will revel in the delectably chilling details--including
      hideous scenes in which a school principal named Mr. Jenkins is impersonated
      by the Echthroi (the evil forces that tear skies, snuff out light, and darken
      planets). When it becomes clear that the Echthroi are putting Charles Wallace
      in danger, the only logical course of action is for Meg and her dear friend
      Calvin O'Keefe to become small enough to go inside Charles Wallace's body--into
      one of his mitochondria--to see what's going wrong with his farandolae. In an
      illuminating flash on the interconnectedness of all things and the relativity
      of size, we realize that the tiniest problem can have mammoth, even intergalactic
      ramifications. Can this intrepid group voyage through time and space and muster
      all their strength of character to save Charles Wallace? It's an exhilarating,
      enlightening, suspenseful journey that no child should miss.

      adventure that is both similar and superior . . . The action is precipitated
      by Charles Wallace's failing health and his difficulties in being accepted by
      other children now that he's started school. Meg and O'Keefe are enlisted again
      to fight evil, this time in the shapre of Echthroi ('Light snuffers. Planet
      darkeners. The dragons. The worms. Those who hate.'), which are spreading through
      the universe. Guided by their mysterious teacher Blajeny and accompanied by
      a myriad-eyed, multiwinged cherubim named Proginoskes, Meg, Calivn and Mr. Jenkins
      (the crusty, unimaginitive school principal with whom Meg ha shad difficulty
      in the past) must pass three ordeals in order to save Charles Wallace from the
      Echthroi. Once again it is love that enables Meg to overcome evil, and L'Engle
      reaches mystical ecstasy in describing Meg's apprehension of the beauty and
      unity of the universe. Complex concepts of space and time are handled well for
      youn greaders, and the author creates a suspensful, life-and-death drama that
      is believably of cosmic significance. Complex and rich in mystical religious
      insights, this is breathtaking entertainment.

    - Aimed at readers who have already encountered Anne Frank, this riveting historical
      novel from Mazer (Missing Pieces, 1995, etc.) is based on a little-known chapter
      of WWII history. Karin Levi's story begins in a tiny attic room in Paris in
      the 1940s, where she is hidden away with her brother, Marc, and their mother,
      practicing the art of quiet. German soldiers are conducting house-to-house searches,
      rounding up Jews, and the small family is soon on the run, depending on strangers
      for scraps of food and shelter. When Maman falls ill, Karin and Marc head for
      Naples without her; the children board the Henry Gibbons, a ship full of European
      refugees bound for Fort Ontario in Oswego, New York. Upon their arrival in America,
      their story turns from one of flight and danger to the happiness and sorrow
      associated with adjusting to a new language, customs, and schooling, and making
      new friends. Although it is a shock to Karin, it comes as no surprise to readers
      when Marc reveals that Maman is dead. Mazer skillfully paints Karin as brave
      and independent, yet depicts her devotion to Maman throughout, writing unsent
      letters and never losing sight of her belief that one day they will be reunited.
      Rather than relying on events and facts of the war and its atrocities to create
      sympathy, the author paints her central character's thoughts and feelings, her
      moments of weakness and her strength, so that the story is stirringly understated.

    - A touching novel that begins in 1940 and ends in 1945. Mazer follows 12-year-old
      Karin Levi and her experiences first as a hidden Jewish child in France, next
      as a traveling refugee, and, finally, as an inmate in the displaced persons
      camp in Oswego, NY. After Karin, her mother, and older brother leave France,
      they stay with a kind man in Italy. When it becomes clear that they must flee,
      the girl's mother is too ill to continue, and the two siblings must leave her
      behind. Throughout the book, the child deals with her feelings of loss by writing
      her mother letters. Mazer captures the refugee experience as Karin travels from
      place to place in constant fear with no sense of belonging, until she finally
      settles in at Oswego. Although the prose occasionally becomes strained and even
      saccharine, such as when the girl refers to her family as her "beloveds," for
      the most part, Karin's voice is realistic. Despite everything she has been through,
      she has her moments of petty jealousy and preteen difficulties. However, when
      her brother finally tells her that their mother did not survive, she manages
      to overcome her grief and look to the future when they will live with their
      father's aunt in California. Libraries looking to expand the scope of their
      Holocaust literature will find this book a welcome addition.

      appreciably familiar world that, as evidence of her storytelling power, still
      strikes an original chord. Elves, an invented vocabulary with Anglo-Nordic roots,
      medieval folk elements, herbalism, gypsies-all contribute to the atmosphere
      of mysticism and magic that suffuses the story of the changeling Saaski. The
      misbegotten offspring of a moorfolk (small, elf-like beings) and a human, Saaski
      is secretly switched with a human baby when the moorfolk discover she lacks
      certain powers. But she is not an ordinary mortal, either; her eyes, for example,
      change color with her mood, and, as she gets older, the local villagers view
      her as an outsider. Rather than a typical fantasy adventure, this is a saga
      of self-discovery as Saaski learns to cope with the pain, often physical, of
      not fitting in and as she learns her true heritage. Transcending genre, these
      themes will likely resonate with a wide audience. '

      ways until they discovered that she couldn''t "wink out" (disappear at will),
      making her a danger to the folk. Changing her into a baby, they switched her
      with a human infant. Now named Saaski, she grows up again, a changeling who

      creates an unusual and absorbing story. Rooted in legend, the story features
      fantasy elements that are convincing, partly because nothing here is solved

      of Friendly, West Virginia, he is not prepared for the ethical questions he
      has to face. Should he return the dog to its owner, only to have the animal
      abused again? Should he tell his parents? Should he steal food to help the poor

    - Marty Preston, 11, is a country boy who learns that things are often not what
      they seem, and that adults are not always "fair" in their dealings with other
      people. Marty finds a stray dog that seems to be abused and is determined to
      keep it at all costs. Because his family is very poor, without money to feed
      another mouth, his parents don't want any pets. Subsequently, there is a lot
      of conflict over the animal within the family and between Marty and Judd Travers,
      the dog's owner. Honesty and personal relations are both mixed into the story.
      Naylor has again written a warm, appealing book. However, readers may have difficulty
      understanding some of the first-person narration as it is written in rural West
      Virginian dialect. Marty's father is a postman--usually one of the better paying
      positions in rural areas--yet the family is extremely poor. There seems to be
      an inconsistency here. This title is not up to Naylor's usual high quality.

    - Brian Robeson, 13, is the only passenger on a small plane flying him to visit
      his father in the Canadian wilderness when the pilot has a heart attack and
      dies. The plane drifts off course and finally crashes into a small lake. Miraculously
      Brian is able to swim free of the plane, arriving on a sandy tree-lined shore
      with only his clothing, a tattered windbreaker, and the hatchet his mother had
      given him as a present. The novel chronicles in gritty detail Brian's mistakes,
      setbacks, and small triumphs as, with the help of the hatchet, he manages to
      survive the 54 days alone in the wilderness. Paulsen effectively shows readers
      how Brian learns patienceto watch, listen, and think before he acts as he attempts
      to build a fire, to fish and hunt, and to make his home under a rock overhang
      safe and comfortable. An epilogue discussing the lasting effects of Brian's
      stay in the wilderness and his dim chance of survival had winter come upon him
      before rescue adds credibility to the story. Paulsen tells a fine adventure
      story, but the sub-plot concerning Brian's preoccupation with his parents' divorce
      seems a bit forced and detracts from the book. As he did in Dogsong (Bradbury,
      1985), Paulsen emphasizes character growth through a careful balancing of specific
      details of survival with the protagonist's thoughts and emotions.- Barbara Chatton

    - A rollicking celebration of an eccentric grandmother and childhood memories.
      Set in the 1930s, the book follows Joe and Mary Alice Dowdel as they make their
      annual August trek to visit their grandmother who lives in a sleepy Illinois
      town somewhere between Chicago and St. Louis. A woman with plenty of moxie,
      she keeps to herself, a difficult task in this small community. However, Grandma
      Dowdel uses her wit and ability to tell whoppers to get the best of manipulative
      people or those who put on airs. She takes matters into her own hands to intimidate
      a father who won't control his unruly sons, and forces the bank to rescind a
      foreclosure on an elderly woman's house. Whether it's scaring a pretentious
      newspaper man back to the city or stealing the sheriff's boat and sailing right
      past him as he drunkenly dances with his buddies at the Rod & Gun Club, she
      never ceases to amaze her grandchildren with her gall and cunning behavior.
      Each chapter resembles a concise short story. Peck's conversational style has
      a true storyteller's wit, humor, and rhythm. Joe, the narrator, is an adult
      looking back on his childhood memories; in the prologue, readers are reminded
      that while these tales may seem unbelievable, "all memories are true." Perfect
      for reading aloud, A Long Way from Chicago is a great choice for family sharing.

    - Grandma Dowdel is not a good influence--and that's one good reason why Joey
      likes visiting her. Each August, from 1929 (when Joey is nine) to 1935, he and
      his younger sister travel by train from Al Capone's Chicago to spend a week
      with Grandma in her scrappy small Illinois town. In seven short stories, one
      for each summer, Grandma lies, cheats, trespasses, and contrives to help the
      town underdogs (including her own worst enemy) outwit the banker, the Holy Rollers,
      and the establishment. Part vaudeville act, part laconic tall tale, the stories,
      with their dirty tricks and cunning plots, make you laugh out loud at the farce
      and snicker at the reversals. Like Grandma, the characters are larger-than-life
      funny, yet Peck is neither condescending nor picturesque. With the tall talk,
      irony, insult, and vulgarity, there's also a heartfelt sense of the Depression's
      time and place, when a knot of people wait outside the store for the day-old
      bread to become half price, and Grandma defies the sheriff, poaches catfish,
      and fries it up to feed the Depression drifters with her home-brewed beer ("They
      didn't thank her. She wasn't looking for thanks"). The viewpoint is adult--elderly
      Joe is looking back now at the changes he saw in those seven years--but many
      young people will recognize the irreverent, contrary voices of their own family
      legends across generations.

    - In a novel that skillfully captures the nuances of small-town life, an elderly
      man reminisces about his annual trips from Chicago to his grandmother's house
      in rural Illinois during the Depression. When the book opens, Joey and his sister,
      Mary Alice, nine and seven, respectively, learn that they will be spending a
      week every August with Grandma Dowdel. In eight vignettes, one for each summer
      from 1929 - 1935, with the final story set when Joey's troop train passes through
      in 1942, Peck (Strays Like Us, 1998) weaves a wry tale that ranges from humorous
      to poignant. Grandma Dowdel, with her gruff persona and pragmatic outlook on
      life, embodies not only the heart of a small town but the spirit of an era gone
      by. She turns the tables on a supercilious reporter from the big city, bests
      the local sheriff, feeds the drifters of the Depression, inspires a brawl between
      elderly (ancient) war heroes, and more. Peck deftly captures the feel of the
      times, from the sublime bliss of rooting around the ice bin at the local store
      for a nickel Nehi during the dog days of summer, to a thrilling flight in a
      biplane. Remarkable and fine.

      will turn him into a good boy.\" Such is the reigning philosophy at Camp Green
      Lake, a juvenile detention facility where there is no lake, and there are no
      happy campers. In place of what used to be \"the largest lake in Texas\" is
      now a dry, flat, sunburned wasteland, pocked with countless identical holes
      dug by boys improving their character. Stanley Yelnats, of palindromic name
      and ill-fated pedigree, has landed at Camp Green Lake because it seemed a better
      option than jail. No matter that his conviction was all a case of mistaken identity,
      the Yelnats family has become accustomed to a long history of bad luck, thanks
      to their \"no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather!\" Despite
      his innocence, Stanley is quickly enmeshed in the Camp Green Lake routine: rising
      before dawn to dig a hole five feet deep and five feet in diameter; learning
      how to get along with the Lord of the Flies-styled pack of boys in Group D;
      and fearing the warden, who paints her fingernails with rattlesnake venom. But
      when Stanley realizes that the boys may not just be digging to build character--that
      in fact the warden is seeking something specific--the plot gets as thick as
      the irony.\r\n\r\nIt's a strange story, but strangely compelling and lovely
      too. Louis Sachar uses poker-faced understatement to create a bizarre but believable
      landscape--a place where Major Major Major Major of Catch-22 would feel right
      at home. But while there is humor and absurdity here, there is also a deep understanding
      of friendship and a searing compassion for society's underdogs. As Stanley unknowingly
      begins to fulfill his destiny--the dual plots coming together to reveal that
      fate has big plans in store--we can't help but cheer for the good guys, and
      all the Yelnats everywhere."

    - Stanley Yelnats IV has been wrongly accused of stealing a famous baseball player's
      valued sneakers and is sent to Camp Green Lake, a juvenile detention home where
      the boys dig holes, five feet deep by five feet across, in the miserable Texas
      heat. It's just one more piece of bad luck that's befallen Stanley's family
      for generations as a result of the infamous curse of Madame Zeroni. Overweight
      Stanley, his hands bloodied from digging, figures that at the end of his sentence,
      he'll "...either be in great physical condition or else dead." Overcome by the
      useless work and his own feelings of futility, fellow inmate Zero runs away
      into the arid, desolate surroundings and Stanley, acting on impulse, embarks
      on a risky mission to save him. He unwittingly lays Madame Zeroni's curse to
      rest, finds buried treasure, survives yellow-spotted lizards, and gains wisdom
      and inner strength from the quirky turns of fate. In the almost mystical progress
      of their ascent of the rock edifice known as "Big Thumb," they discover their
      own invaluable worth and unwavering friendship. Each of the boys is painted
      as a distinct individual through Sachar's deftly chosen words. The author's
      ability to knit Stanley and Zero's compelling story in and out of a history
      of intriguing ancestors is captivating. Stanley's wit, integrity, faith, and
      wistful innocence will charm readers. A multitude of colorful characters coupled
      with the skillful braiding of ethnic folklore, American legend, and contemporary
      issues is a brilliant achievement. There is no question, kids will love Holes.

      and an overriding conflict between good and evil. The orphaned Baudelaire children,

      a drafty old house that teeters dangerously above the leech-filled Lake Lachrymose.

    - This is "Book the Third" in a series about the wealthy and clever but unfortunate
      Baudelaire children who were orphaned in a tragic fire. Pursued by the evil
      Count Olaf, who murdered their parents and their last caregiver, 14-year-old
      Violet, 12-year-old Klaus, and baby Sunny are sent to elderly Aunt Josephine,
      a strange, fearful widow and grammarian. She lives in a house built on precarious
      stilts on the side of a hill overlooking Lake Lachrymose, inhabited by killer
      leeches. Of course, Count Olaf tracks them down and, disguised as a sailboat
      captain, fools Aunt Josephine-at least for a while. Olaf is ultimately exposed
      but not before he pushes Aunt Josephine into the leech-infested waters. So,
      the Baudelaires must find a new caregiver, who will be revealed to readers in
      "Book the Fourth." The writing is tongue-in-cheek John Bellairs, E. Nesbit,
      or Edward Eager with a little Norton Juster thrown in. The style is similar
      to the many books with old houses and rocky shores in Maine or Great Britain
      including the Edward Goreyesque illustrations. Unfortunately, the book misses
      the mark. The narrator is humorous but intrusive, explaining words and providing
      many obvious clues that surface later. Aunt Josephine's constant correction
      of vocabulary and grammar, while at first humorous, becomes annoying. The book
      is really not bad; it just tries too hard and there are so many similar books

    - When his father returns East to collect the rest of the family, 13-year-old
      Matt is left alone to guard his family's newly built homestead. One day, Matt
      is brutally stung when he robs a bee tree for honey. He returns to consciousness
      to discover that his many stings have been treated by an old Native American
      and his grandson. Matt offers his only book as thanks, but the old man instead
      asks Matt to teach his grandson Attean to read. Both boys are suspicious, but
      Attean comes each day for his lesson. In the mornings, Matt tries to entice
      Attean with tales from Robinson Crusoe, while in the afternoons, Attean teaches
      Matt about wilderness survival and Native American culture. The boys become
      friends in spite of themselves, and their inevitable parting is a moving tribute
      to the ability of shared experience to overcome prejudice. The Sign of the Beaver
      was a Newbery Honor Book; author Elizabeth Speare has also won the Newbery Medal
      twice, for The Witch of Blackbird Pond and The Bronze Bow.

    - Maniac Magee is a folk story about a boy, a very excitable boy. One that can
      outrun dogs, hit a home run off the best pitcher in the neighborhood, tie a
      knot no one can undo. "Kid's gotta be a maniac," is what the folks in Two Mills
      say. It's also the story of how this boy, Jeffrey Lionel "Maniac" Magee, confronts
      racism in a small town, tries to find a home where there is none and attempts
      to soothe tensions between rival factions on the tough side of town. Presented
      as a folk tale, it's the stuff of storytelling. "The history of a kid," says
      Jerry Spinelli, "is one part fact, two parts legend, and three parts snowball."
      And for this kid, four parts of fun. Maniac Magee won the 1991 Newbery Medal.

    - In this modern-day tall tale, Spinelli presents a humorous yet poignant look
      at the issue of race relations, a rare topic for a work aimed at middle readers.
      Orphaned as an infant, Jerry Magee is reared by his feuding aunt and uncle until
      he runs away at age eight. He finds his way to Two Mills, Pa., where the legend
      of "Maniac" Magee begins after he scores major upsets against Brian Denehy,
      the star high school football player, and Little League tough guy, John McNab.
      In racially divided Two Mills, the Beales, a black family, take Maniac in, but
      despite his local fame, community pressure forces him out and he returns to
      living at the zoo. Park groundskeeper Grayson next cares for the boy, but the
      old man dies and Maniac moves into the squalid home of the McNabs, who are convinced
      a race war is imminent. After a showdown with his nemesis, Mars Bar, Maniac
      bridges the gap between the two sides of town and finally finds a home. Full
      of snappy street-talk cadences, this off-the-wall yarn will give readers of
      all colors plenty of food for thought.

    - ! 'Warning: this interesting book is a mythical story about racism. It should
      not be read as reality. Legend springs up about Jeffrey "Maniac" Magee, a white
      boy who runs faster and hits balls farther than anyone, who lives on his own
      with amazing grace, and is innocent as to racial affairs. After running away
      from a loveless home, he encounters several families, in and around Two Mills,
      a town sharply divided into the black East End and the white West End. Black,
      feisty Amanda Beale and her family lovingly open their home to Maniac, and tough,
      smart-talking "Mars Bar" Thompson and other characters are all, to varying degrees,
      full of prejudices and unaware of their own racism. Racial epithets are sprinkled
      throught the book; Mars Bar calls Maniac "fishbelly," and blacks are described
      by a white character as being "today''s Indians." In the final, disjointed section
      of the book, Maniac confronts the hatred that perpetuates ignorance by bringing
      Mars Bar to meet the Pickwells--"the best the West End had to offer." In the
      feel-good ending, Mars and Maniac resolve their differences; Maniac gets a home
      and there is hope for at least improved racial relations. Unreal? Yes. It''s
      a cop-out for Spinelli to have framed this story as a legend--it frees him from
      having to make it real, or even possible. Nevertheless, the book will stimulate
      thinking about racism, and it might help educate those readers who, like so
      many students, have no first-hand knowledge of people of other races. Pathos
      and compassion inform a short, relatively easy-to-read story with broad appeal,
      which suggests that to solve problems of racism, people must first know each
      other as individuals.'

      survival. In 1942, 11-year-old Phillip Enright lives with his parents on the
      Dutch island of Curaçao, but when the war moves too close for comfort, his mother
      decides to travel with him back to the safety of Virginia. When their boat is
      torpedoed, however, Phillip is blinded and finds himself adrift on a life raft
      with an old black man and a cat. They eventually land on a deserted island.
      Phillip is suspicious of "the large Negro," but soon grows to trust--and ultimately
      love--the patient and generous Timothy. Dedicated to "Dr. King''s Dream," The
      Cay has a clear message that friendship is colorblind; it is also a terrific
      adventure story of a young, newly blinded man learning to survive on an uninhabited

      Americans across the United States before, during, and after the Civil Rights
      Movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Tillage describes the trials of sharecropping;
      trying to get an education in an inferior school; and walking a long distance
      to school while watching a bus full of white children pass him by. The author
      witnessed the murder of his father when a group of drunken white teenagers ran
      over the man. What price do you place on a human life? The father of the driver
      gave Mrs. Tillage 100 dollars and told his son to apologize. He never did. There
      was never any legal action taken. The events are succinctly and honestly expressed
      in the author''s first-person account. Roth''s monochromatic collage art, placed
      before the beginning of each chapter, documents the sparseness of Tillage''s
      life and its boundaries: home, church, school, work, and the balcony at the
      movie theater. The last story, "Marching," explains the role of many groups
      of southerners, representing a number of ethnic groups who supported and helped
      the marchers. The afterword and note about the genesis of the book are important

    - Tillage, a black custodian in a Baltimore private school, reminisces about his
      childhood as a sharecropper's son in the South, and his youth as a civil-rights
      protester. He explains the mechanics of sharecropping and segregation, tells
      of his mistreatment and his father's murder at the hands of white teenagers
      out to ``have some fun,'' and relates his experiences with police dogs, fire
      hoses, and jail while following Martin Luther King's ideas of nonviolent protest.
      Tillage matter-of-factly recounts horrific events, using spare language that
      is laced with remarkable wisdom, compassion, and optimism. Such gentleness only
      gives his story more power, as he drives home the harder realities of his childhood.
      Although the collage illustrations are interesting, they are too moody and remote
      for the human spirit behind the words, and readers will regret Roth's decision--especially
      in light of the boy smiling so brightly on the cover--that ``even one photo

      a girl she hardly knows and her twin sister to spend a week at grandmother's
      farm. When they finally come, Clara and Nettie, the more outgoing of the two,
      are drawn to each other. Patty, the shy twin, accepts this friendship and plays
      with Clara's younger siblings or entertains herself. Shortly after they return
      to school, Nettie is struck down by a cerebral hemorrhage. During the months
      she is in a coma, Patty and Clara comfort one another, but they realize that
      neither one can replace a best friend or beloved sister. When Nettie finally
      comes home, she slowly regains physical and some mental capabilities, but she
      is a shell of her former self. Clara invites her to the farm hoping to rekindle
      her spirit. Finally, her understanding mother and wise grandmother help Clara
      accept Nettie as she is. Although the medical problem here is severe and unusual,
      it serves to show how events can change friendships yet leave them still important
      and valued. This warm, tender first novel will touch the hearts of readers with

      school years, . . . not one single teacher ever said to me, 'Perhaps you should
      consider becoming a writer,'\" Byars recalls. \"Anyway, I didn't want to be
      a writer. Writing seemed boring. You sat in a room all day by yourself and typed.
      If I was going to be a writer at all, I was going to be a foreign correspondent
      like Claudette Colbert in Arise My Love. I would wear smashing hats, wisecrack
      with the guys, and have a byline known round the world. My father wanted me
      to be a mathematician.\" So Byars set out to become mathematician, but when
      she couldn't grasp calculus in college, she turned to English. Even then, writing
      was not on her immediate horizon.\r\n\r\nFirst, she married and started a family.
      The writing career didn't emerge until she was 28, a mother of two children,
      and living in a small place she called the barracks apartment, in Urbana, Illinois.
      She and her husband, Ed, had moved there in 1956 so he could attend graduate
      school at the University of Illinois. She was bored, had no friends, and so
      turned to writing to fill her time. Byars started writing articles for The Saturday
      Evening Post, Look,and other magazines. As her family grew and her children
      started to read, she began to write books for young people and, fortunately
      for her readers, discovered that there was more to being a writer than sitting
      in front of a typewriter.\r\n\r\n\"Making up stories and characters is so interesting
      that I'm never bored. Each book has been a different writing experience. It
      takes me about a year to write a book, but I spend another year thinking about
      it, polishing it, and making improvements. I always put something of myself
      into my books -- something that happened to me. Once a wanderer came by my house

      Salamanca Tree Hiddle's mother leaves home suddenly on a spiritual quest, vowing
      to return, but can't keep her promise. The girl and her father leave their farm
      in Kentucky and move to Ohio, where Sal meets Phoebe Winterbottom, also 13.
      While Sal accompanies her eccentric grandparents on a six-day drive to Idaho
      to retrace her mother's route, she entertains them with the tale of Phoebe,
      whose mother has also left home. While this story-within-a-story is a potentially
      difficult device, in the hands of this capable author it works well to create
      suspense, keep readers' interest, and draw parallels between the situations
      and reactions of the two girls. Sal's emotional journey through the grieving
      process-from denial to anger and finally to acceptance-is depicted realistically
      and with feeling. Indeed, her initial confusion and repression of the truth
      are mirrored in the book. Overall, a richly layered novel about real and metaphorical

      Here Karen Cushman helps the American Gold Rush spring to colorful life, just

      time in an 1849 mining camp--a milieu far removed from the Middle Ages of her
      first novels, but not all that different when it comes to living standards.
      Arvella Whipple and her three children, Sierra, Butte, and 11-year-old California
      Morning, make a fresh start in Lucky Diggins, a town of mud, tents, and rough-hewn
      residents. It''s a far cry from Massachusetts; as her mother determinedly settles
      in, California rebelliously changes her name to Lucy and starts saving every
      penny for the trip back east. Ever willing to lose herself in a book when she
      should be doing errands, Lucy is an irresistible teenager; her lively narration
      and stubborn, slightly naive self-confidence (as well as a taste for colorful
      invective: ``Gol durn, rip-snortin'' rumhole and cussed, dad-blamed, dag diggety,
      thundering pisspot,'''' she storms) recall the narrator of Catherine, Called
      Birdy (1994), without seeming as anachronistic. Other characters are drawn with
      a broader brush, a shambling platoon of unwashed miners with hearts (and in
      one case, teeth) of gold. Arvella eventually moves on, but Lucy has not only
      lost her desire to leave California, but found a vocation as well: town librarian.

      story, Cushman remains on a roll. '

    - ! 'With its vivid descriptions of life in Lucky Diggins, an 1850''s California
      mining town, and its cast of colorful characters, Karen Cushman''s third novel
      (Clarion/HM, 1996) has all the ingredients for an outstanding read-aloud. Christina
      Moore more than delivers the goods: her crisp, energetic narrative captures
      the grit of the rough and tumble life in the story, while also giving unique
      voice to each character. There''s Bernard Freeman, a former slave for whom freedom
      is the true gold to be found in California; Brother Claymore, a free-thinking
      minister who spreads his message of hope and inspiration beneath the canvas
      of a revival tent; and Snowshoe Ballou who finally leaves Lucky Diggins for
      the mountains with the following lament: "Mighty purty country once, afore it
      was fished and logged and mined to death." The two main characters are 12-years-old
      Lucy, who uses her considerable drive toward a much longed for return to the
      civilized world of her native New England, and Lucy''s widowed mother, Arvella,
      a down-to-earth pioneer with an unquenchable thirst for adventure. This is also
      a tale of two strong-willed women locked in a mother-daughter conflict. Cushman''s
      forceful writing combined with a narration in which the characters live and
      breathe make this a first choice for libraries.'

    - ! 'A peaceful, tropical world is the setting for Morning Girl, a simple yet
      rich glimpse into the lives of a young sister and brother. Morning Girl and
      Star Boy grapple with timeless, universal issues such as experiencing simultaneous
      anger and love toward family members and the quest to discover the true self.
      As all siblings do, these children respond to, play off of, and learn from each
      other. Precisely where Morning Girl and Star Boy are growing up is not revealed,
      but it''s clearly a place where the residents have no modern amenities. Living
      in harmony with nature is a necessary priority here, and--given the descriptive
      names of the characters--a Native Indian culture seems likely. But not until
      the epilogue do readers discover that the story takes place in 1492. Suddenly
      we realize that the strange-looking visitors Morning Girl welcomes to shore
      are not as harmless as they may appear. The excerpt from Christopher Columbus''s
      journal provides an ominous footnote: these gentle people, who seem so very
      much like us, will not be permitted their idyllic existence much longer. '

      whether she lives or dies. At 13, an orphan, and unhappily married, Miyax runs
      away from her husband's parents' home, hoping to reach San Francisco and her
      pen pal. But she becomes lost in the vast Alaskan tundra, with no food, no shelter,
      and no idea which is the way to safety. Now, more than ever, she must look hard
      at who she really is. Is she Miyax, Eskimo girl of the old ways? Or is she Julie
      (her "gussak"-white people-name), the modernized teenager who must mock the
      traditional customs? And when a pack of wolves begins to accept her into their
      community, Miyax must learn to think like a wolf as well. If she trusts her
      Eskimo instincts, will she stand a chance of surviving?

      life after the ball isn''t necessarily lived happily ever after. Her prince
      is decidedly not charming, and castle life is cushy, but superficial and repressive.
      Then Ella meets tutor Jed Reston, a lively companion and social activist. Their
      relationship inspires her to rethink her wishes and priorities and to embark
      on a challenging quest to find true happiness in life and love. In lively prose,

      of the glass slippers. In her version, Ella (sans \"Cinder\") finds her own
      way to the ball (there was no fairy godmother, despite the rumors) and wins
      the heart of the prince. But now she is finding that life at the palace as Prince
      Charming's betrothed is not as great as she thought it was going to be. In fact,
      it's downright boring for a self-reliant and active girl to do needlework all
      day or listen to instructions on court etiquette from the strict and cold Madame
      Bisset. Worst of all, Ella is beginning to suspect that Charming's beautiful
      blue eyes and golden hair are attached to a head with nothing in it. Her young
      tutor Jed, however, talks with her about serious things that really matter.
      Ella finally gets up the courage to announce to Charming that she doesn't want
      to go through with the wedding, but when she finds herself locked in the dungeon
      she realizes it's not that easy to walk away from a politically arranged marriage.
      In the end, as in all good fairy tales, our heroine and hero do manage to live
      happily ever after--but with a twist.\r\n\r\nFairy tale retellings are an entrancing
      form of young adult fiction, as they add psychological insight and turn events

      Jo writes in sparse, free-floating verse. In this compelling, immediate journal,
      Billie Jo reveals the grim domestic realities of living during the years of
      constant dust storms: That hopes--like the crops--blow away in the night like
      skittering tumbleweeds. That trucks, tractors, even Billie Jo's beloved piano,
      can suddenly be buried beneath drifts of dust. Perhaps swallowing all that grit
      is what gives Billie Jo--our strong, endearing, rough-cut heroine--the stoic
      courage to face the death of her mother after a hideous accident that also leaves
      her piano-playing hands in pain and permanently scarred.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Billie
      Jo's silent, windblown father is literally decaying with grief and skin cancer
      before her very eyes. When she decides to flee the lingering ghosts and dust
      of her homestead and jump a train west, she discovers a simple but profound
      truth about herself and her plight. There are no tight, sentimental endings
      here--just a steady ember of hope that brightens Karen Hesse's exquisitely written
      and mournful tale. Hesse won the 1998 Newbery Award for this elegantly crafted,
      gut-wrenching novel, and her fans won't want to miss The Music of Dolphins or
      Letters from Rifka."

    - Fourteen-year-old Billie Jo's life is defined by struggle both physical and
      emotional. She struggles to forgive her father for causing the accident that
      killed her mother. She fights a daily battle to survive during the worst days
      of the Oklahoma dust storms. And she strives to heal her body and her soul when
      severe burns leave her disfigured and unable to play the music she loves. Set
      during the time of the Great Depression and written in free verse, Karen Hesse's
      spare but powerful work (Scholastic, 1997) captures every nuance of Billie Jo's
      emotions, from heartwrenching sadness at the death of her mother and newborn
      brother to the challenge of rebuilding a relationship with her embittered father.
      Read with disarming simplicity and straightforwardness by Marika Mashburn, an
      Oklahoma native, the titled and dated entries span the course of a year during
      which Billie Jo's reflections lead her to draw on qualities she never knew she
      possessed. Powerful and moving, this 1998 Newbery Medal winner is a recommended
      purchase for all school and public libraries.

      dreams of playing the piano. Finding a way through her grief is not made easier
      by her taciturn father, who went on a drinking binge while Billie Joe''s mother,
      not yet dead, begged for water. Told in free-verse poetry of dated entries that
      span the winter of 1934 to the winter of 1935, this is an unremittingly bleak
      portrait of one corner of Depression-era life. In Billie Jo, the only character

    - Katie's first word is "kira-kira," the Japanese word for "glittering," and she
      uses it to describe everything she likes. It was taught to her by her older
      sister, Lynn, whom Katie worships. Both girls have trouble adjusting when their
      parents move the family from Iowa to a small town in rural Georgia, where they
      are among only 31 Japanese-Americans. They seldom see their parents, who have
      grueling jobs in chicken-processing plants. Then Lynn becomes deathly ill, and
      Katie is often left to care for her, a difficult and emotionally devastating
      job. When her sister dies of lymphoma, Katie searches for ways to live up to
      her legacy and to fulfill the dreams she never had a chance to attain. Told
      from Katie's point of view and set in the 1950s, this beautifully written story
      tells of a girl struggling to find her own way in a family torn by illness and
      horrendous work conditions. Katie's parents can barely afford to pay their daughter's
      medical bills, yet they refuse to join the growing movement to unionize until
      after Lynn's death. All of the characters are believable and well developed,
      especially Katie, who acts as a careful observer of everything that happens
      in her family, even though there is a lot she doesn't understand. Especially
      heartbreaking are the weeks leading up to Lynn's death, when Katie is exhausted
      and frustrated by the demands of her sister's illness, yet willing to do anything
      to make her happy. Girls will relate to and empathize with the appealing protagonist.--Ashley

    - Katie Takeshima worships her older sister, Lynn, who knows everything and takes
      care of Katie while their parents are working long hours in their small Georgia
      town in the late 1950s. It's Lynn who shows Katie the glittering beauty (kira-kira)
      of the stars and who prepares Katie for the prejudice she will encounter as
      one of the few Japanese American kids in their school. But when Katie is 10,
      Lynn, 14, falls ill, and everything changes. Slowly the roles are reversed;
      Katie becomes caregiver and does what Lynn has taught her. There's no surprise.
      It's clear that Lynn will die, and Katie goes through all the stages of grief.
      The real story is in the small details, never self-consciously "poetic" but
      tense with family drama. In her first novel for young people, Kadohata stays
      true to the child's viewpoint in plain, beautiful prose that can barely contain
      the passionate feelings. Just as heart wrenching as the sisters' story is what
      Katie knows of her father's struggle, whether it's his backbreaking work in
      the factory or his love for his family. The quiet words will speak to readers
      who have lost someone they love--or fear that they could. Hazel Rochman

    - ! "Madeleine L’Engle (1918-2007) was the Newbery Medal-winning author of more
      than 60 books, including the much-loved A Wrinkle in Time. Born in 1918, L’Engle
      grew up in New York City, Switzerland, South Carolina and Massachusetts.  Her
      father was a reporter and her mother had studied to be a pianist, and their
      house was always full of musicians and theater people. L’Engle graduated cum
      laude from Smith College, then returned to New York to work in the theater.
      While touring with a play, she wrote her first book, The Small Rain, originally
      published in 1945. She met her future husband, Hugh Franklin, when they both
      appeared in The Cherry Orchard.\r\n \r\nUpon becoming Mrs. Franklin, L’Engle
      gave up the stage in favor of the typewriter. In the years her three children
      were growing up, she wrote four more novels. Hugh Franklin temporarily retired
      from the theater, and the family moved to western Connecticut and for ten years
      ran a general store. Her book Meet the Austins, an American Library Association
      Notable Children's Book of 1960, was based on this experience.\r\n \r\nHer science
      fantasy classic A Wrinkle in Time was awarded the 1963 Newbery Medal. Two companion
      novels, A Wind in the Door and A Swiftly Tilting Planet (a Newbery Honor book),
      complete what has come to be known as The Time Trilogy, a series that continues
      to grow in popularity with a new generation of readers. Her 1980 book A Ring
      of Endless Light won the Newbery Honor. L’Engle passed away in 2007 in Litchfield,

    - In this delightful memoir, Sterling North recalls his year with Rascal--a very
      mischievous and resourceful raccoon. Sterling, a boy of 11, watches in amazement
      as this baby raccoon, barely the size of Sterling's hand, instinctively washes
      everything before eating it. Sterling knows that every night Rascal will sneak
      into the house by hooking his claws onto the back screen door and head straight
      for Sterling's bed! Virtually everywhere Sterling goes, Rascal is there, and
      life is filled with one adventure after another.

    - Adaline Falling Star is the mixed-race daughter of famed frontier scout Kit
      Carson and Singing Wind, an Arapaho Indian woman. When Adaline's mother dies
      and her father leaves on an expedition through the Rockies, the 11-year-old
      is sent to live with Kit's cousins in St. Louis. Mistreated and misunderstood
      in "the land of apples and book-larnin'," Adaline flees and, accompanied only
      by a mongrel dog, sets off in search of her father, who has mysteriously failed
      to return. Attracted to both free roaming and what she calls "the Fruits of
      Civilization," Adaline is a child of two very different and often conflicting
      worlds. Osborne does a good job of dramatizing this life story, which is not
      only a quest for a missing father but also a search for personal identity. Told
      in the girl's colorful frontier voice, this is an engaging tale of true grit
      and self-discovery. An author's note describes Osborne's sources for this fictionalized
      account. Michael Cart

    - ! "Legendary scout Kit Carson's sassy daughter Adaline, or Falling Star, as
      her Arapaho mother called her before succumbing to cholera, is mute with grief.
      Her widowed father has left her with his racist, cruel relatives until he returns
      from his Rocky Mountain expedition. But her cousins' treatment of her is more
      than she can bear. Instead of allowing her to go to school, they force her to
      work as a servant in the schoolhouse. Due to her \"half-breed\" status, she
      is barely considered human. Her mixed heritage causes her plenty of internal
      confusion, as well.\r\n\r\n    \"I'm a mix, I reckon, of white and red blood,
      and also a jumbled love for free roaming and the Fruits of Civilization, which
      is what Doc Hempstead calls reading, writing, and geography.\" \r\n\r\nAdaline's
      intelligence and sensitivity keep her alive when her impulsiveness provokes
      her to run away to find her father. Her bravery and gritty frontier resourcefulness
      rival her father's, but her compassion is all her own.\r\n\r\nIn this lively
      and touching account, Mary Pope Osborne has fictionalized the life of Kit Carson's
      real but little-known daughter. Osborne is the renowned author of the very popular
      Magic Tree House series, as well as many other books for children and young
      adults, including a collection of yarns about American folk heroes called American
      Tall Tales.- Emilie Coulter"

    - This historical novel set at the beginning of the Civil War actually opens in
      1916, as 15-year-old Howard Leland Hutchings recounts his trip in a Model T
      to visit his father's childhood home in Grand Tower, IL. When he and his younger
      brothers meet the four elderly people who raised their father, the novel shifts
      to 1861, and the narrator shifts to 15-year-old Tilly Pruitt, the boys' grandmother.
      When a steamboat from New Orleans brings two mysterious young ladies, Mama offers
      them room and board, and the Pruitts' lives are forever changed. Fair and beautiful
      Delphine Duval, with her fancy dresses and high-society ways, fascinates the
      family. And what of Calinda, the darker-skinned young woman? Could she be Delphine's
      slave? On the eve of his 16th birthday, Tilly's twin brother, Noah, leaves to
      join the Union troops at Camp Defiance and Mama, distraught, sends Tilly and
      Delphine to bring him home. It is here that Tilly learns of Delphine's heritage.
      She is a quadroon, part of the colored family of a rich white man. Her mother
      sent her daughters away from New Orleans, hoping Delphine can pass for white.
      The novel ends with a return to 1916 and Howard's finding out his father's true
      parentage. In this thoroughly researched novel, Peck masterfully describes the
      female Civil War experience, the subtle and not-too-subtle ways the country
      was changing, and the split in loyalty that separated towns and even families.
      Although the book deals with some weighty themes, it is not without humor. A
      scene involving strapping on a corset is worthy of Grandma Dowdel herself.

      Ridge Mountains, Carrie finds that the government is buying all the local farms
      and burning the homes to convert the area to the new Shenandoah National Park.
      Grandpa, who has a general store with a lunchroom run by Grandma, refuses to
      sell and fights every step of the way; but though he tries to get neighbors
      to join his battle, many are glad for the chance to move to towns and conveniences.
      Carrie is torn between admiring and believing in her increasingly obsessive
      Grandpa''s cause and appreciating Grandma''s common-sense approach. Staunchly,
      she stands up for Grandpa to local bullies and various officious people, meanwhile
      learning that it''s a good thing to have strong feelings and to express them.
      Grandpa''s battle may drag on a bit, but Carrie''s increasing strength and her
      fierce loyalties hold attention as she learns that relations mean more than
      locations, and that losing may not be so bad if you have tried as hard as you
      can. '

    - Ryan uses the experiences of her own Mexican grandmother as the basis for this
      compelling story of immigration and assimilation, not only to a new country
      but also into a different social class. Esperanza's expectation that her 13th
      birthday will be celebrated with all the material pleasures and folk elements
      of her previous years is shattered when her father is murdered by bandits. His
      powerful stepbrothers then hold her mother as a social and economic hostage,
      wanting to force her remarriage to one of them, and go so far as to burn down
      the family home. Esperanza's mother then decides to join the cook and gardener
      and their son as they move to the United States and work in California's agricultural
      industry. They embark on a new way of life, away from the uncles, and Esperanza
      unwillingly enters a world where she is no longer a princess but a worker. Set
      against the multiethnic, labor-organizing era of the Depression, the story of
      Esperanza remaking herself is satisfyingly complete, including dire illness
      and a difficult romance. Except for the evil uncles, all of the characters are
      rounded, their motives genuine, with class issues honestly portrayed. Easy to
      booktalk, useful in classroom discussions, and accessible as pleasure reading,
      this well-written novel belongs in all collections.- Francisca Goldsmith

      Kit Tyler is filled with trepidation. As they sail up the river to Kit's new
      home, the teasing and moodiness of a young sailor named Nat doesn't help. Still,
      her unsinkable spirit soon bobs back up. What this spirited teenager doesn't
      count on, however, is how her aunt and uncle's stern Puritan community will
      view her. In the colonies of 1687, a girl who swims, wears silk and satin gowns,

    - ! "\"She was homeschooling gone amok.\" \"She was an alien.\" \"Her parents
      were circus acrobats.\" These are only a few of the theories concocted to explain
      Stargirl Caraway, a new 10th grader at Arizona's Mica Area High School who wears
      pioneer dresses and kimonos to school, strums a ukulele in the cafeteria, laughs
      when there are no jokes, and dances when there is no music. The whole school,
      not exactly a \"hotbed of nonconformity,\" is stunned by her, including our
      16-year-old narrator Leo Borlock: \"She was elusive. She was today. She was
      tomorrow. She was the faintest scent of a cactus flower, the flitting shadow
      of an elf owl.\"\r\n\r\nIn time, incredulity gives way to out-and-out adoration
      as the student body finds itself helpless to resist Stargirl's wide-eyed charm,
      pure-spirited friendliness, and penchant for celebrating the achievements of
      others. In the ultimate high school symbol of acceptance, she is even recruited
      as a cheerleader. Popularity, of course, is a fragile and fleeting state, and
      bit by bit, Mica sours on their new idol. Why is Stargirl showing up at the
      funerals of strangers? Worse, why does she cheer for the opposing basketball
      teams? The growing hostility comes to a head when she is verbally flogged by
      resentful students on Leo's televised Hot Seat show in an episode that is too
      terrible to air. While the playful, chin-held-high Stargirl seems impervious
      to the shunning that ensues, Leo, who is in the throes of first love (and therefore
      scornfully deemed \"Starboy\"), is not made of such strong stuff: \"I became
      angry. I resented having to choose. I refused to choose. I imagined my life
      without her and without them, and I didn't like it either way.\"\r\n\r\nJerry
      Spinelli, author of Newbery Medalist Maniac Magee, Newbery Honor Book Wringer,
      and many other excellent books for teens, elegantly and accurately captures
      the collective, not-always-pretty emotions of a high school microcosm in which
      individuality is pitted against conformity. Spinelli's Stargirl is a supernatural
      teen character--absolutely egoless, altruistic, in touch with life's primitive
      rhythms, meditative, untouched by popular culture, and supremely self-confident.
      It is the sensitive Leo whom readers will relate to as he grapples with who
      she is, who he is, who they are together as Stargirl and Starboy, and indeed,
      what it means to be a human being on a planet that is rich with wonders.- Karin

    - Belle Prater becomes the stuff of local legend in Coal Station, Virginia, when
      she disappears, leaving everyone mystified. Because his father drinks, Belle's
      boy, cross-eyed Woodrow, comes to live with his grandparents on the finest residential
      street in town; and 12-year-old Gypsy, his cousin who lives next door and narrates
      the story, is glad to get to know him. Like everyone else, she is curious about
      his mother; but Woodrow will only tell her a fantastic story about a magical
      place. Nevertheless, the girl comes to admire her cousin for the way he uses
      his superior intelligence and pleasant personality to adapt to a more affluent
      life, fend off rude questions about his mother, and handle the local bully.
      Gypsy seems to lead an idyllic life, but when a schoolmate puts a face on her
      recurring nightmare, she collapses in the rush of long-repressed sorrow. White
      paints a vivid picture of small town Appalachia in the 1950s, from the ostracism
      of a blind "sin eater" to the preening of social "wannabes." Characterization
      is superb. Gypsy's evolving understanding of her late father's values and her
      stepfather's virtues is especially well done. White's message-that there is
      no protection for any of us from pain, only a variety of ways to handle it-
      is delivered with just right dollops of humor and love. What's important, as
      Gypsy's grandmother puts it, is to let our true selves shine. A delightful read
      by a real truth teller.-Cindy Darling Codell

    - When her poor, cross-eyed, hill country cousin, Woodrow, comes to live next
      door, Gypsy thinks she'll get on the inside track of a family mystery, the disappearance
      of Woodrow's mother. Gypsy soon learns, however, that Woodrow isn't talking,
      so she begins concentrating, instead, on his thoughtful nature, puckish charm,
      and talent for telling grand stories. It's only during odd moments that Gypsy
      catches a glimpse of Woodrow's real sadness, but to push him to talk about his
      mother before he's ready might mean Gypsy would have to face up to a painful
      secret of her own. Several themes neatly dovetail in this unpretentious, moving
      story set in Appalachia in the 1950s. Humor and insight infuse a solid picture
      of small-town life as two strongly depicted young characters uncover an important
      truth some grown-ups never learn. Stephanie Zvirin

    - ! "The moment Maggy Hamilton steps into the happy lives of the Austin family,
      she disrupts their harmonious world, bringing with her all the sullenness and
      insolence of her own misery.\r\nVicky Austin knows she should sympathize with
      Maggy for being an orphan, but she can't help but resent her for making life
      so difficult. It looks like Maggy may be a member of the family for a long time,
      possibly forever. Vicky remembers the happy times and finally accepts that things
      will never be the same, but she wonders what's to come."

      all over Europe, find themselves on the run, seeking safety wherever they can

      ability to endure even the most extraordinary circumstances.

      Linney carried an apple seed from France to Charleston. The seed that Stephanie
      nurtured in the wild Kentucky soil, the "tree of freedom" as she called it,
      was not merely a link with the past, but a symbol of the new way of life that
      the pioneering families meant to build in the fresh green land. More than just
      a story of homesteading, this is a warm and interesting study of character and

      eager to go and fight on the side of the North. One night a mysterious girl
      arrives on a steamboat bound for St. Louis. Delphine is unlike anyone the small
      river town has even seen. Mrs. Pruitt agrees to take Delphine and her dark,
      silent traveling companion in as boarders. No one in town knows what to make
      of the two strangers, and so the rumors fly. Is Delphine's companion a slave?
      Could they be spies for the South? Are the Pruitts traitors? A masterful tale
      of mystery and war, and a breathtaking portrait of the lifelong impact one person
      can have on another.- Connie Tyrrell Burns

      saw the dark outline of a stone house against the spruce trees—a house where
      only an old cellar hole should have been. Then she saw a surrey come by, carrying
      a lady dressed in plum- colored silk. The woman beckoned for Greta to join her,
      and soon Greta found herself launched on an adventure that would take her back
      to a past that existed only through the magic of the fog.
