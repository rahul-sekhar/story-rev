    - Mrs. Frisby, a widowed mouse with four small children, is faced with a terrible
      problem. She must move her family to their summer quarters immediately, or face
      almost certain death. But her youngest son, Timothy, lies ill with pneumonia
      and must not be moved. Fortunately, she encounters the rats of NIMH, an extraordinary
      breed of highly intelligent creatures, who come up with a brilliant solution
      to her dilemma. And Mrs. Frisby in turn renders them a great service.

    - From Emilie Coulter's Amazon.com Review
    - This unusual novel, winner of the Newbery Medal (among a host of other accolades)
      snags the reader on page one and reels in steadily all the way through to the
      exhilarating conclusion. Robert O'Brien has created a small but complete world
      in which a mother's concern for her son overpowers her fear of all her natural
      enemies and allows her to make some extraordinary discoveries along the way.
      O'Brien's incredible tale, along with Zena Bernstein's appealing ink drawings,
      ensures that readers will never again look at alley rats and field mice in the
      same way.

    - ! 'This short novel is a study of grief--chiefly, that felt by Summer after
      her foster mother''s sudden death, but also her sorrow at witnessing the grief
      of Ob, her foster father--she realizes that she herself may not be reason enough
      for him to go on living. And for several months it seems as if he may not in
      fact go on, until Summer and Ob take a short car trip that somehow transforms
      their lives. In a direct, matter-of-fact voice occasionally laced with irony
      and wry humor, Summer articulates many discerning insights about sorrow and
      loss. The reader remains a distant observer of her emotions, however--perhaps
      because the novel begins after May''s death, making her a less immediate figure,
      perhaps because Summer''s perceptions are quite sophisticated, even adult. And
      the novel''s emotional turning point is difficult to grasp, either verbally
      or intuitively: all Summer, and we, know is that "something happened to Ob"
      to make him embrace life fully again. '

    - ! 'A gifted writer returns to one of her favorite themes--love- -in this case,
      as it can inform and transform grief. After her mother''s death, Summer was
      handed from one unwilling relative to another, ``treated like a homework assignment
      somebody was always having to do.'''' At six, she was taken in by an elderly
      uncle and aunt. Ob had a game leg (WW II) and enjoyed creating unusual whirligigs;
      May liked gardening behind their West Virginia trailer. They loved each other
      with a deep and abiding love, wholeheartedly including Summer. Now, six years
      later, May has died. In a poetic, ruminative narrative, Summer recounts Ob''s
      mounting depression, his growing conviction that May is still present, and their
      expedition to find ``Miriam B. Conklin: Small Medium at Large.'''' Meanwhile,
      they''ve been befriended by Cletus, an odd, bright boy in Summer''s class; she
      doesn''t especially value his company, but is intrigued by his vocabulary (``surreal'''';
      ``Renaissance Man'''') and his offhand characterization of her as a writer.
      The quest seems to fail- -Reverend Conklin has died--but on the way home Ob
      finally puts aside his grief to take the two young people to the state capitol
      as promised: ``Right out of the blue, he wanted to live again.'''' Rylant reveals
      a great deal about her four characters, deftly dropping telling details from
      the past into her quiet story--including a glimpse of Summer, as seen by a girl
      in her class, ``like some sad welfare case,'''' a description the reader who
      has read her thoughts will know to be gloriously untrue. A beautifully written,
      life-affirming book.'

      she answers.\r\n\"Papa sang, too.\"\r\n\r\nTheir mother died the day after Caleb
      was born. Their house on the prairie is quiet now, and Papa doesn't sing anymore.
      Then Papa puts an ad in the paper, asking for a wife, and he receives a letter
      from one Sarah Elisabeth Wheaton, of Maine. Papa, Anna, and Caleb write back.
      Caleb asks if she sings. Sarah decides to come for a month. She writes Papa:
      I will come by train. I will wear a yellow bonnet. I am plain and tall, and
      Tell them I sing. Anna and Caleb wait and wonder. Will Sarah be nice? Will she
      like them? Will she stay?\r\n"

    - MacLachlan.. has written an affecting tale for children. In the late 19th century
      a widowed midwestern farmer with two children--Anna and Caleb--advertises for
      a wife. When Sarah arrives she is homesick for Maine, especially for the ocean
      which she misses greatly. The children fear that she will not stay, and when
      she goes off to town alone, young Caleb--whose mother died during childbirth--is
      stricken with the fear that she has gone for good. But she returns with colored
      pencils to illustrate for them the beauty of Maine, and to explain that, though
      she misses her home, "the truth of it is I would miss you more." The tale gently
      explores themes of abandonment, loss and love.

      the magic.\r\n\r\nAnd that would never have happened if he and his sister, Ann,
      hadn't been sent to stay with their bossy cousins for the summer. And that wouldn't
      have happened at all if their father hadn't gotten sick and gone into the hospital.\r\n\r\nBut
      all of that did happen, and now Roger, his sister, and their cousins find themselves
      in a bygone world of chivalry and knighthood, of Robin Hood and Ivanhoe. In
      this knightly realm they can make a difference -- and perhaps even save the
      person they most need to save -- if only they are smart and brave enough, if
      only they are true to their hearts."

    - In this laugh-out-loud novel, a young teen on the fast track to the juvenile
      detention center suddenly finds himself living in rural North Carolina with
      the outrageously eccentric Applewhite clan. Jake Semple, 13, has been expelled
      from a long line of schools before coming to the Applewhites to be homeschooled.
      This extended family forms what a visiting reporter christens an "artistic dynasty,"
      with various creative endeavors absorbing the adults' time and attention. Jake
      is left largely to his own devices, since the family doesn't believe in telling
      their charges what or when to study. He develops a loyal following consisting
      of an active four-year-old and an overweight basset hound, and his transformation
      is complete once he becomes enmeshed in the family's production of The Sound
      of Music. Quirky characters, from the cub reporter to the visiting guru, add
      to the offbeat humor. The Applewhites' over-the-top personalities mark them
      as literary kin of Helen Cresswell's Bagthorpes. Running beneath the narrative
      that gently pokes fun at everything from sculpture to TV documentaries, though,
      is also the story of a boy allowing himself to belong and begin to discover
      his own potential. This has terrific booktalk and read-aloud potential, and
      will help fill the need for humorous contemporary fiction.

    - ! "Every kid thinks about running away at one point or another; few get farther
      than the end of the block. Young Sam Gribley gets to the end of the block and
      keeps going--all the way to the Catskill Mountains of upstate New York. There
      he sets up house in a huge hollowed-out tree, with a falcon and a weasel for
      companions and his wits as his tool for survival. In a spellbinding, touching,
      funny account, Sam learns to live off the land, and grows up a little in the
      process. Blizzards, hunters, loneliness, and fear all battle to drive Sam back
      to city life. But his desire for freedom, independence, and adventure is stronger.
      No reader will be immune to the compulsion to go right out and start whittling
      fishhooks and befriending raccoons.\r\nJean Craighead George, author of more
      than 80 children's books, including the Newbery Medal-winning Julie of the Wolves,
      created another prizewinner with My Side of the Mountain--a Newbery Honor Book,
      an ALA Notable Book, and a Hans Christian Andersen Award Honor Book. Astonishingly,
      she wrote its sequel, On the Far Side of the Mountain, 30 years later, and a
      decade after that penned the final book in the trilogy, Frightful's Mountain,
      told from the falcon's point of view. George has no doubt shaped generations
      of young readers with her outdoor adventures of the mind and spirit."

    - In a world with no poverty, no crime, no sickness and no unemployment, and where
      every family is happy, 12-year-old Jonas is chosen to be the community's Receiver
      of Memories. Under the tutelage of the Elders and an old man known as the Giver,
      he discovers the disturbing truth about his utopian world and struggles against
      the weight of its hypocrisy. With echoes of Brave New World, in this 1994 Newbery
      Medal winner, Lowry examines the idea that people might freely choose to give
      up their humanity in order to create a more stable society. Gradually Jonas
      learns just how costly this ordered and pain-free society can be, and boldly
      decides he cannot pay the price.

    - In a complete departure from her other novels, Lowry has written an intriguing
      story set in a society that is uniformly run by a Committee of Elders. Twelve-year-old
      Jonas's confidence in his comfortable "normal" existence as a member of this
      well-ordered community is shaken when he is assigned his life's work as the
      Receiver. The Giver, who passes on to Jonas the burden of being the holder for
      the community of all memory "back and back and back," teaches him the cost of
      living in an environment that is "without color, pain, or past." The tension
      leading up to the Ceremony, in which children are promoted not to another grade
      but to another stage in their life, and the drama and responsibility of the
      sessions with The Giver are gripping. The final flight for survival is as riveting
      as it is inevitable. The author makes real abstract concepts, such as the meaning
      of a life in which there are virtually no choices to be made and no experiences
      with deep feelings. This tightly plotted story and its believable characters
      will stay with readers for a long time.

    - Figuring she'll never get adopted because of her caramel-colored skin and crippled
      leg, Rocky finds herself chosen by Emma and Fred, a kind, indulgent, alcoholic
      couple from Bolton, Kansas. It's in Bolton that she finds her devoted dog, Python,
      who leads her to Mick, the rumpled artist hired to design a monument to the
      town's war dead and the person who changes Rocky's view of life, art, and the
      world. Through the drawings he makes in order to get a feel for the town's people
      and history, the citizens of Bolton see themselves and their surroundings in
      a new light, although they're not sure they like it. As Mick does with his sketches,
      Paulsen tells the story in quick, deft strokes. The gossip at the grain elevator
      on a summer day, Rocky's insecurities and toughness, and the varied characters
      are vividly yet succinctly conveyed. In just three days, Mick breezes into town,
      turns Rocky on to the power of art, and convinces the people of Bolton that
      a grove of trees will be an appropriate monument as well as an artistic statement.
      Avoiding a lot of artistic jargon, Paulsen carries readers along with his (and
      Mick's) strong images and enthusiasm. A powerful, affecting story with its comments
      on art and homage. --Susan Knorr, Milwaukee Public Library

    - his unusual book provides an insider's look at the life of Birdy, 14, the daughter
      of a minor English nobleman. The year is 1290 and the vehicle for storytelling
      is the girl's witty, irreverent diary. She looks with a clear and critical eye
      upon the world around her, telling of the people she knows and of the daily
      events in her small manor house. Much of Birdy's energy is consumed by avoiding
      the various suitors her father chooses for her to marry. She sends them all
      packing with assorted ruses until she is almost wed to an older, unattractive
      man she refers to as Shaggy Beard. In the process of telling the routines of
      her young life, Birdy lays before readers a feast of details about medieval
      England. The book is rich with information about the food, dress, religious
      beliefs, manners, health, medical practices, and sanitary habits (or lack thereof)
      of the people of her day. From the number of fleas she kills in an evening to
      her herbal medicines laced with urine, Birdy reveals fascinating facts about
      her time period. A feminist far ahead of her time, she is both believable and
      lovable. A somewhat philosophical afterword discusses the mind set of medieval
      people and concludes with a list of books to consult for further information
      about the period. Superb historical fiction.

    - This powerful novel deals with a difficult yet important topic-rape. Melinda
      is just starting high school. It should be one of the greatest times in her
      life, but instead of enjoying herself, she is an outcast. She has been marked
      as the girl who called the police to break up the big end-of-the-summer party,
      and all the kids are angry at her. Even her closest friends have pulled away.
      No one knows why she made the call, and even Melinda can't really articulate
      what happened. As the school year goes on, her grades plummet and she withdraws
      into herself to the point that she's barely speaking. Her only refuge is her
      art class, where she learns to find ways to express some of her feelings. As
      her freshman year comes to an end, Melinda finally comes to terms with what
      happened to her-she was raped at that party by an upperclassman who is still
      taunting her at school. When he tries again, she finds her voice, and her classmates
      realize the truth. The healing process will take time, but Melinda no longer
      has to deal with it alone. Anderson expresses the emotions and the struggles
      of teenagers perfectly. Melinda's pain is palpable, and readers will totally
      empathize with her. This is a compelling book, with sharp, crisp writing that
      draws readers in, engulfing them in the story.

      taking a vacation with the warm, compassionate Austins--an extraordinary family
      who takes a little girl named Maggy Hamilton under its wing when her father
      is killed in a plane accident. Adjusting to a new household member is not easy,
      as the 12-year-old narrator, Vicky, will testify. Maggy is spoiled, \"ubiquitous,\"
      laughs in a \"horrid, screechy way,\" and appears to be a child of an entirely
      different species from the thoughtful, intelligent, kind, yet not cloyingly
      so, Austin kids. Still, Vicky and her other siblings (Rob, Suzy, and John) grit
      their collective teeth and struggle to understand her, which becomes easier
      and easier as the loving family seems to rub off on the newly orphaned Maggy.\r\nThe
      Austins are beyond question a charming family, but their path is by no means
      rock-free: Vicky sneaks off to a friend's house and severely injures herself
      in a bike accident, they all get the measles, John is beat up after his guest
      sermon in church, and they almost lose little Rob. Despite ordinary family setbacks,
      there's no use pretending this is a run-of-the-mill family. When Vicky is sick,
      her older brother, John, comes into her room and soothes her with a discussion
      of the solar system, our atomic composition, and the relativity of size. Family
      dinner-table talk includes the ethics of meat eating, and a chat with Grandfather
      ends up with a discussion of whether Einstein believed in God. As in all of
      L'Engle's novels, she asks the big questions: What is the meaning of life, and
      how does death fit into that? Are there different kinds of intelligence? What
      happens when you remove a screw from a radiator? This strangely comforting novel,
      first published in 1960, is an ALA Notable Book, and was followed by four other
      books featuring the Austin Family: The Moon by Night, The Young Unicorns, A
      Ring of Endless Light (a Newbery Honor Book), and Troubling a Star-Karin Snelson"

      are. He''s also afraid of Tony''s sharp tongue, though, so he asks his father

    - Twelve-year-old Joel has unwillingly agreed to bike out to the state park with
      his daredevil friend Tony. "On his honor," he promises his father to be careful,
      knowing that Tony wants them to climb the dangerous park bluffs. When they arrive,
      however, Tony abruptly changes his mind and heads for the river. With his promise
      jangling in his mind, Joel follows Tony in for a swim. Tony drowns in the dirty,
      turbulent water, leaving Joel to face his guilty conscience, and his father,
      alone. In this short but solid novel, Bauer effectively portrays the dilemma
      of pre-adolescents, old enough to want to meet their own challenges without
      adult interference, young enough to want grownup protection and reassurance.
      Joel understands only too well the moral dilemma he faces, but he is so bound
      by peer pressure that wrong choices and tragedy are almost inevitable. Bauer's
      association of Joel's guilt with the smell of the polluted river on his skin
      is particularly noteworthy. Its miasma almost rises off the pages. Descriptions
      are vivid, characterization and dialogue natural, and the style taut but unforced.
      A powerful, moving book.

      desire to clap erasers, and her travails in acquiring a giant beet. Then there's
      the whole concept of being a substitute rat. Through it all, Ellen's friendship
      with Austine, and their quarrel and eventual reconciliation provide the thread

    - ! 'Second grade is not turning out the way it should for Ramona Quimby. Her
      dad has lost his job, her mom has found a full-time job, and her big sister
      Beezus has "reached a difficult age." In her inimitable way, Ramona decides
      to take charge. She practices TV commercials in hopes of earning a million dollars,
      but only ends up insulting her teacher and getting into a prickly mess with
      some burrs. Then she embarks on a campaign to make her father stop smoking.
      Mr. Quimby manages to hold up under all these strains, but the challenge is
      on for the whole family to prove their mettle. '

    - ! "From the first day of third grade, when Ramona Quimby meets her eventual
      nemesis Yard Ape, life moves on at its usual wild pace--usual for the boisterous
      Ramona, that is. Soon she is accidentally squashing a raw egg into her hair
      at the school cafeteria, being forced to play Uncle Rat with her annoying young
      neighbor, and, worst of all, throwing up in her classroom. The responsibilities
      of an 8-year-old are sometimes daunting, especially in a family that is trying
      to squeak by while the father goes back to school. But Ramona is full of too
      much vim and vigor to ever be down for long.\r\n\r\nIn her second Newbery Honor
      Book about Ramona (the first was Ramona and Her Father), Beverly Cleary presents
      another slice of the Quimby family life. Author of more than two dozen children's
      books, Cleary has a true knack for understanding the tangle of thoughts and
      emotions in a child's mind and heart. Empathic, witty, and astute, she has earned
      many other awards, including the Newbery Medal for Dear Mr. Henshaw. Alan Tiegreen's
      clever line drawings have charmed countless readers of Cleary's books over the
      years, and his style is now inextricably tied to hers.--Emilie Coulter "

    - The engaging tale of young Ramona Quimby's first days in kindergarten, Ramona
      the Pest takes a pint-sized perspective on the trials and delights of beginning
      school. Ramona can't wait to learn all the important things. But she's disappointed
      when her teacher can't fill in missing parts of story lines, such as how Mike
      Mulligan went to the bathroom while digging the basement of the town hall. Nonetheless,
      Ramona loves her teacher, and loves going to school in spite of the torments--having
      to wear hand-me-down boots, for example, or having to (sometimes) suppress the
      urge to pull on another girl's "boing-boing" curls. Ramona's energetic take
      on life appeals to children who have passed through this stage, or who are dealing
      with a kindergarten-age sibling who is exhibiting Ramona-ish tendencies.--Richard

      landed on his feet. He belongs to the Brickers-a young couple who dote on him.
      Then a baby arrives in the household and Socks discovers that the people he'd
      trained so well no longer consider him the center of their universe. This is
      devastating, but eventually he finds a new place that everyone can be happy
      with. This is an hilarious book by Beverly Cleary, told from the cat's point
      of view, and Neil Patrick Harris does a slam-bang job of presenting it. Readers
      feel a kinship with Socks and root for his success, even while acknowledging
      his foibles. Both children and adults with roar with laughter at Sock's antics
      and cringe at his misdeeds.--Teresa Bateman

    - Roles are changed when young Prince Brat, as everyone calls him (he is so altogether
      rotten that "Not even black cats would cross his path"), runs away with Jemmy,
      his whipping boy (the commoner who takes the Prince's punishments). Because
      Brat has never learned to write and Jemmy can, a couple of prince-nappers decide
      that Jemmy is the real prince. Chiefly through Jemmy's cleverness, the two escape
      and return to court. Brat has learned much and changed for the better during
      his adventures. He winds up calling Jemmy "friend," and he is certain to be
      a better prince hereafter.

      scores a hit with his new creation. Sis's skillful pictures emphasize events
      in the adventures of the orphan Jemmy, kept in his king's palace to be thrashed
      for the offenses committed by the royal heir, known as Prince Brat. It is forbidden
      to punish Brat, whose tricks multiply until Jemmy is tempted to escape the daily
      round of flogging. But the prince himself takes off and forces the whipping
      boy to go with him. As they get into and out of trouble on the outside, Jemmy
      hears that he has been accused of abducting Brat. When the prince arranges for
      their return to the palace, poor Jemmy fears the worst, but things turn out
      for the best at the story's satisfying close. Colorful types like a thief called
      Hold-Your-Nose Billy, Betsy and her dancing bear Petunia, et al., increase the
      fun.

    - Identical in format and length to its predecessor, Catwings , this new book
      picks up where that one left off. The four winged catsThelma, Roger, Harriet
      and Jamesare content in the country barn where they live, secretly cared for
      by humans Hank and Susan. But they would like to see their mother, and the dumpster
      where they were born. Only James and Harriet make the trip, and learn that the
      slums are being destroyed by demolition crews. Their mother and the dumpster
      have moved; instead, they find a winged kitten. After a brief reunion with their
      mother, who now lives amidst flower pots on an apartment roof, all three felines
      go to the farm. Some of this repeats the first book, such as the absence of
      a father, the mother who bravely, and perhaps somewhat curiously, sends the
      children away to a better life, and the rather dull goodness of the human boy
      and girl. Le Guin's graceful writingespecially of the adventurous rescue of
      the new member of the family and in the roof sceneis sweetly illuminated by
      Schindler's delicately tinted drawings.

    - James and Harriet, the youngest and most adventurous of four winged cats, return
      from the country refuge that they found in Catwings to the inner-city slum where
      they were born, to see their mother again. They find a frightened winged kitten
      before finding their mother, the genteel Mrs. Jane Tabby. She is delighted to
      see her grown children and grateful that they've brought back her lost kitten.
      She insists that they take the kitten to safety in the country. This may grate
      on those who criticized as unfeeling Mrs. Jane's decision, in the first book,
      to send her older children off to a new life so that she could begin a new liaison
      unfettered, but it seems in character. Although characterization is slight,
      there is enough to win readers' sympathy. This gently appealing story will mean
      more to those who enjoyed the more vigorous first book, but it is hard to resist
      a story that brings a terrified, lonely kitten home to a loving family. The
      illustrations are engaging pen-and-ink drawings with watercolor wash. A handsome

      Ereth leave Dimwood Forest in search of Ragweed''s parents to tell them the
      sad news so that Poppy can "get on with her life." When they finally reach their
      destination, they discover it''s hardly the "dullsville" that Ragweed had described.
      In fact, his family has been forced to leave their comfortable nest and move
      to higher ground: a clan of development-mad beavers are flooding out the residents
      in their efforts to turn the pastoral backwater into "Canad''s Cute Condos."
      Along the way, Poppy encounters Ragweed''s dreamy, poetic brother Rye, and before
      long the two mice are head over paws in love. When a showdown between the scheming
      beavers and the reluctantly heroic mice puts Rye in danger, Poppy risks everything
      to save him. Of course, all''s well that ends well in this rollicking tale,
      which Avi infuses with generous helpings of adventure, romance and humor. He
      juggles multiple story lines effortlessly, and his characterizations are particularly
      engaging, from the blustering Caster P. Canad ("Bless my teeth and smooth my

    - Still grieving over the loss of her beau Ragweed of Poppy (1995), the intrepid
      deer mouse decides to bring the sad news to his family in this uneven, heavy-handed
      sequel. Setting out from Dimwood Forest with her hopelessly infatuated porcupine
      friend, Ereth, Poppy arrives just in time to help Ragweed's parents and numerous
      siblings avert eviction. Led by ruthless Caster P. Canad, a crew of beavers
      has dammed up the nearby brook in preparation for a housing project. The mice
      have already been flooded out of one home, and their new one is about to be
      threatened. Saddened--but also secretly relieved to be out from under his brother's
      shadow--dreamy Rye dashes out to see what he can do against the beavers, and
      is quickly captured. Having fallen in love with him at first sight, Poppy organizes
      a rescue, urging the meek mice to fight back; they do. The bad guys silently
      depart, and Poppy and Rye set a date. Avi develops his characters to a level
      of complexity that provides a distracting contrast with the simplistic story,
      an obvious take on human land-use disputes, and easily distinguishable victims
      and villains. In language more ugly than colorful, Ereth chews over his feelings
      for Poppy in several plot-stopping passages, and is last seen accompanying the
      happy couple back to Dimwood. Readers may wonder who to root for in this disappointing
      follow-up to one of the best animal stories in years.

      a clock-fixing tomboy running wild in the woods of Wisconsin. In 1864, this
      is a bit much for her Boston-bred mother to bear, but Caddie and her brothers
      are happy with the status quo. Written in 1935 about Carol Ryrie Brink''s grandmother''s
      childhood, the adventures of Caddie and her brothers are still exciting over
      60 years later. With each chapter comes another ever-more exciting adventure:
      a midnight gallop on her horse across a frozen river to warn her American Indian
      friends of the white men''s plan to attack; a prairie fire approaching the school
      house; and a letter from England that may change the family''s life forever.
      This Newbery Medal-winning book bursts at the seams with Caddie''s irrepressible
      spirit. In spite of her mother''s misgivings, Caddie is a perfect role model

      when Junior spots a police car coming up their road. Maggie and Vern run to
      hide in the woods, while Junior loses his grip on the roof and slides off, breaking

      Pap, their grandfather, has been arrested for disturbing the peace while he
      was, innocently enough, trying to retrieve the 2147 beer and pop cans that had
      spilled out of the back of his pick-up. Byars' characters are memorableespecially
      Vern, who manages to "break into" jail to be with Pap, thus causing a news sensation,
      and Ralphie, Junior's hospital roommate. The plot, however, is contrived in
      many ways. Readers are never told why police is "one of the most dreaded words
      in the family vocabulary," and credibility is stretched thin by Vern's jail
      break-in and by Maggie's and Ralphie's managing to wheel Juniorwith both legs
      in caststo Pap's hearing without being apprehended by hospital personnel. While
      this is not Byars' strongest book, the off-beat characters, crisp dialogue and
      fast-paced action will keep readers turning the pages.

    - Mr. Maxwell has taught fifth-grade science and supervised the class weeklong
      field trip to a nearby New Hampshire state park for many years. He is sure of
      his teaching methods and equally confident that his respect for nature is transmitted,
      a hundred students at a time, through the sessions in the woods. Mark Chelmsley,
      clearly bright, bored, and (in Mr. Maxwell's opinion) probably spoiled, moves
      to the small New Hampshire town just weeks before the trip. It's inevitable
      that the two clash. The third-person narrative alternates between the powerful
      adult and the lonely, stalwart boy, allowing readers to see both characters'
      strengths and weaknesses. At the end of the week in the woods, both boy and
      man have changed. Clements' compassionate character studies are realistic and
      hopeful, and the characters' subtle conflicts and eventual transformations will
      linger with readers long after the book is finished.

    - Angered by his family's move from Scarsdale, NY, to rural New Hampshire, Mark
      refuses to make friends or please his teachers. Because of his indifference,
      one teacher decides that he's dealing with a "slacker" and a "spoiled rich kid."
      To make matters worse, the fifth grader acts unimpressed with Mr. Maxwell's
      annual outing to the state park for a week of nature studies. However, the boy
      becomes increasingly interested in the outdoors and camping and signs up for
      the trip. On the first day there, the teacher discovers Mark with a camping
      tool that contains a knife, an item that students were asked not to bring. He
      decides that someone needs to teach the boy a lesson and decides to send him
      home. Mark runs away, gets lost, and must use his newly acquired skills to survive
      a night in the woods. The story explores both Mark's and Mr. Maxwell's point
      of view, and the final resolution of their conflict is effective. The boy's
      relationships with his ever-absent parents and his caregivers are interestingly
      developed. The novel includes a helpful map of the state park. Like many of
      Clements's titles, this one will be a popular choice, particularly with fans
      of Gary Paulsen and Jean Craighead George.

    - Mark, the 11-year-old at the center of Clements's (Frindle; The Jacket) brooding
      and uneven novel, initially has no interest in making friends at his new school
      in Whitson, N.H., where his constantly traveling parents have just renovated
      and enlarged a 1798 farmhouse. Knowing that he's headed off to a prestigious
      boarding school next year, the boy has no incentive for pleasing his teachers
      and spends much of the day gazing out the classroom window. His science teacher,
      Mr. Maxwell, passes judgment on Mark before the boy finally decides to give
      the school a chance ("The only kind of people Mr. Maxwell disliked more than
      slackers were... buy-the-whole-world rich folks"). A showdown between boy and
      teacher occurs at the start of the annual environmental program organized by
      Mr. Maxwell for the fifth graders, who spend a week in a wooded state park.
      The teacher's discovery of Mark with a tool containing a knife (which actually
      belongs to another boy) climaxes with a pursuit through the woods. Unfortunately,
      the suspenseful sequence that follows and the engaging denouement account for
      only a fraction of the novel. Laborious passages about Mark's family's home
      and barn and the boy's preparations for the school trip, plus perhaps a bit
      too much description of Mr. Maxwell's background, bog down the story line and
      may derail readers drawn to the book's enticing title.

    - Life in the wilderness has just become a lot thornier for young Sam Gribley.
      For the last two years he's been living in a hollowed-out tree in the Catskill
      Mountains, hunting and gathering his food supply and befriending the critters
      in his "neighborhood." Sam's peaceful existence is abruptly shattered when an
      environmental conservation officer confiscates his peregrine falcon, Frightful.
      To make matters worse, Sam's sister Alice, who has been living with him for
      the past year, has disappeared. This double blow quickly puts Sam on the trail
      to the far side of his mountain, pursuing a multifaceted mystery that, ultimately,
      will force him to make the biggest decision of his life.

    - ! 'Fans of My Side of the Mountain will be delighted to find that Sam Gribley
      still lives in a hollow tree with Frightful, his faithful falcon. Sam has neighbors
      now: his sister Alice lives in a nearby treehouse and his old friend Bando has
      bought a nearby cabin. Sam''s summer plans are disrupted when a conservation
      officer accuses him of harboring an endangered species and confiscates Frightful.
      Sam is so devastated by the loss of his companion that several days pass before
      he realizes that Alice has left home. Setting out to track his sister down,
      Sam crosses paths with a band of falcon smugglers and is given the chance to
      take back Frightful for his own. Faced with a difficult decision, Sam chooses
      wisely and the story ends on a satisfying note, full of hope for the future.
      Since nature has become chic in the years since Sam''s first adventures were
      published, sophisticated readers will enjoy the author''s wry references to
      the new fashion for Adirondack furniture and her description of an eatery that
      specializes in gourmet wild foods. Filled with accurate details (it is possible
      to trace Sam''s journey on a map), likeable characters and plenty of backwoods
      lore, this sequel is worthy of its predecessor.'

    - More than 30 years later, the story of Sam Gribley is resumed shortly after
      it ended in My Side of the Mountain (Dutton, 1988) . When Frightful, the falcon,
      is confiscated and Sam's sister Alice disappears, Sam and his friend Bando look
      for her. In their search, they uncover a ring of illegal falcon dealers and
      come to terms with their limits and responsibilities as individual humans within
      the larger society of all mountain dwellers. Using a straightforward, first-person
      narrative and journal entries, George effectively evokes the natural setting
      with which she is obviously familiar. She also takes great care to describe
      the devices Sam and Alice construct to make their serene yet rugged life easier.
      These contraptions are complicated, but are clarified by black-and-white sketches.
      Sam remains the focus of the novel, but characters are abundant in contrast
      to his earlier solitary lifestyle. Unfortunately, they play mainly as a catalyst
      for Sam's actions and development. While their presence injects a note of reality,
      it also underscores the incredibility of the story, for the more contact Sam
      has with civilization, the more remarkable his living situation becomes. The
      plot is considerably more complicated than in the first book, and current issues
      are raised, but the timelessness of theme and setting is carried over from the
      original. The contrivance of the black-market bird dealer may serve as a device
      to engage readers' interest, but the strength of the story lies in Sam's personal
      observations and growth. This volume can be enjoyed without the background laid
      in the first book, and it will inspire many readers to investigate the beginning
      of Sam's story. --Starr LaTronica

      Giff gets across a strong sense of what it was like on the home front during
      World War II. Lily makes up stories about her involvement with spies, submarines,
      and anti-Nazi plots in her small seaside town in 1944, but underlying her melodrama
      and lies is grief for her dead mother. When Lily''s father has to leave to fight
      in France, she is so hurt and furious that she refuses even to say good-bye
      to him. As she gets to know Albert, an orphaned Hungarian refugee, she learns
      about his secret anguish: he is guilt-stricken about the younger sister he left
      behind (he, also, didn''t say good-bye), and he is determined, somehow, to cross
      the ocean and find her. The happy ending, when Lily''s father finds Albert''s
      sister in France, is too contrived, but the reunion scenes at home are heartbreaking.
      The friendship story is beautifully drawn: both Lily and Albert are wary, reluctant,
      and needy; they quarrel as much as they bond, and in the end, they help each
      other to be brave. Hazel Rochman'

    - In her usual masterful way, Madeleine L'Engle jumps seamlessly from a child's
      world of liverwurst and cream cheese sandwiches to deeply sinister, cosmic battles
      between good and evil. Children will revel in the delectably chilling details--including
      hideous scenes in which a school principal named Mr. Jenkins is impersonated
      by the Echthroi (the evil forces that tear skies, snuff out light, and darken
      planets). When it becomes clear that the Echthroi are putting Charles Wallace
      in danger, the only logical course of action is for Meg and her dear friend
      Calvin O'Keefe to become small enough to go inside Charles Wallace's body--into
      one of his mitochondria--to see what's going wrong with his farandolae. In an
      illuminating flash on the interconnectedness of all things and the relativity
      of size, we realize that the tiniest problem can have mammoth, even intergalactic
      ramifications. Can this intrepid group voyage through time and space and muster
      all their strength of character to save Charles Wallace? It's an exhilarating,
      enlightening, suspenseful journey that no child should miss.

    - The chief characters of A Wrinkle in Time return in a complex sci-fi / fantasy
      adventure that is both similar and superior . . . The action is precipitated
      by Charles Wallace's failing health and his difficulties in being accepted by
      other children now that he's started school. Meg and O'Keefe are enlisted again
      to fight evil, this time in the shapre of Echthroi ('Light snuffers. Planet
      darkeners. The dragons. The worms. Those who hate.'), which are spreading through
      the universe. Guided by their mysterious teacher Blajeny and accompanied by
      a myriad-eyed, multiwinged cherubim named Proginoskes, Meg, Calivn and Mr. Jenkins
      (the crusty, unimaginitive school principal with whom Meg ha shad difficulty
      in the past) must pass three ordeals in order to save Charles Wallace from the
      Echthroi. Once again it is love that enables Meg to overcome evil, and L'Engle
      reaches mystical ecstasy in describing Meg's apprehension of the beauty and
      unity of the universe. Complex concepts of space and time are handled well for
      youn greaders, and the author creates a suspensful, life-and-death drama that
      is believably of cosmic significance. Complex and rich in mystical religious
      insights, this is breathtaking entertainment.

    - Aimed at readers who have already encountered Anne Frank, this riveting historical
      novel from Mazer (Missing Pieces, 1995, etc.) is based on a little-known chapter
      of WWII history. Karin Levi's story begins in a tiny attic room in Paris in
      the 1940s, where she is hidden away with her brother, Marc, and their mother,
      practicing the art of quiet. German soldiers are conducting house-to-house searches,
      rounding up Jews, and the small family is soon on the run, depending on strangers
      for scraps of food and shelter. When Maman falls ill, Karin and Marc head for
      Naples without her; the children board the Henry Gibbons, a ship full of European
      refugees bound for Fort Ontario in Oswego, New York. Upon their arrival in America,
      their story turns from one of flight and danger to the happiness and sorrow
      associated with adjusting to a new language, customs, and schooling, and making
      new friends. Although it is a shock to Karin, it comes as no surprise to readers
      when Marc reveals that Maman is dead. Mazer skillfully paints Karin as brave
      and independent, yet depicts her devotion to Maman throughout, writing unsent
      letters and never losing sight of her belief that one day they will be reunited.
      Rather than relying on events and facts of the war and its atrocities to create
      sympathy, the author paints her central character's thoughts and feelings, her
      moments of weakness and her strength, so that the story is stirringly understated.

    - A touching novel that begins in 1940 and ends in 1945. Mazer follows 12-year-old
      Karin Levi and her experiences first as a hidden Jewish child in France, next
      as a traveling refugee, and, finally, as an inmate in the displaced persons
      camp in Oswego, NY. After Karin, her mother, and older brother leave France,
      they stay with a kind man in Italy. When it becomes clear that they must flee,
      the girl's mother is too ill to continue, and the two siblings must leave her
      behind. Throughout the book, the child deals with her feelings of loss by writing
      her mother letters. Mazer captures the refugee experience as Karin travels from
      place to place in constant fear with no sense of belonging, until she finally
      settles in at Oswego. Although the prose occasionally becomes strained and even
      saccharine, such as when the girl refers to her family as her "beloveds," for
      the most part, Karin's voice is realistic. Despite everything she has been through,
      she has her moments of petty jealousy and preteen difficulties. However, when
      her brother finally tells her that their mother did not survive, she manages
      to overcome her grief and look to the future when they will live with their
      father's aunt in California. Libraries looking to expand the scope of their
      Holocaust literature will find this book a welcome addition.

      misbegotten offspring of a moorfolk (small, elf-like beings) and a human, Saaski
      is secretly switched with a human baby when the moorfolk discover she lacks
      certain powers. But she is not an ordinary mortal, either; her eyes, for example,
      change color with her mood, and, as she gets older, the local villagers view
      her as an outsider. Rather than a typical fantasy adventure, this is a saga
      of self-discovery as Saaski learns to cope with the pain, often physical, of
      not fitting in and as she learns her true heritage. Transcending genre, these
      themes will likely resonate with a wide audience. '

    - Marty Preston, 11, is a country boy who learns that things are often not what
      they seem, and that adults are not always "fair" in their dealings with other
      people. Marty finds a stray dog that seems to be abused and is determined to
      keep it at all costs. Because his family is very poor, without money to feed
      another mouth, his parents don't want any pets. Subsequently, there is a lot
      of conflict over the animal within the family and between Marty and Judd Travers,
      the dog's owner. Honesty and personal relations are both mixed into the story.
      Naylor has again written a warm, appealing book. However, readers may have difficulty
      understanding some of the first-person narration as it is written in rural West
      Virginian dialect. Marty's father is a postman--usually one of the better paying
      positions in rural areas--yet the family is extremely poor. There seems to be
      an inconsistency here. This title is not up to Naylor's usual high quality.

    - Brian Robeson, 13, is the only passenger on a small plane flying him to visit
      his father in the Canadian wilderness when the pilot has a heart attack and
      dies. The plane drifts off course and finally crashes into a small lake. Miraculously
      Brian is able to swim free of the plane, arriving on a sandy tree-lined shore
      with only his clothing, a tattered windbreaker, and the hatchet his mother had
      given him as a present. The novel chronicles in gritty detail Brian's mistakes,
      setbacks, and small triumphs as, with the help of the hatchet, he manages to
      survive the 54 days alone in the wilderness. Paulsen effectively shows readers
      how Brian learns patienceto watch, listen, and think before he acts as he attempts
      to build a fire, to fish and hunt, and to make his home under a rock overhang
      safe and comfortable. An epilogue discussing the lasting effects of Brian's
      stay in the wilderness and his dim chance of survival had winter come upon him
      before rescue adds credibility to the story. Paulsen tells a fine adventure
      story, but the sub-plot concerning Brian's preoccupation with his parents' divorce
      seems a bit forced and detracts from the book. As he did in Dogsong (Bradbury,
      1985), Paulsen emphasizes character growth through a careful balancing of specific
      details of survival with the protagonist's thoughts and emotions.- Barbara Chatton

    - A rollicking celebration of an eccentric grandmother and childhood memories.
      Set in the 1930s, the book follows Joe and Mary Alice Dowdel as they make their
      annual August trek to visit their grandmother who lives in a sleepy Illinois
      town somewhere between Chicago and St. Louis. A woman with plenty of moxie,
      she keeps to herself, a difficult task in this small community. However, Grandma
      Dowdel uses her wit and ability to tell whoppers to get the best of manipulative
      people or those who put on airs. She takes matters into her own hands to intimidate
      a father who won't control his unruly sons, and forces the bank to rescind a
      foreclosure on an elderly woman's house. Whether it's scaring a pretentious
      newspaper man back to the city or stealing the sheriff's boat and sailing right
      past him as he drunkenly dances with his buddies at the Rod & Gun Club, she
      never ceases to amaze her grandchildren with her gall and cunning behavior.
      Each chapter resembles a concise short story. Peck's conversational style has
      a true storyteller's wit, humor, and rhythm. Joe, the narrator, is an adult
      looking back on his childhood memories; in the prologue, readers are reminded
      that while these tales may seem unbelievable, "all memories are true." Perfect
      for reading aloud, A Long Way from Chicago is a great choice for family sharing.

    - Grandma Dowdel is not a good influence--and that's one good reason why Joey
      likes visiting her. Each August, from 1929 (when Joey is nine) to 1935, he and
      his younger sister travel by train from Al Capone's Chicago to spend a week
      with Grandma in her scrappy small Illinois town. In seven short stories, one
      for each summer, Grandma lies, cheats, trespasses, and contrives to help the
      town underdogs (including her own worst enemy) outwit the banker, the Holy Rollers,
      and the establishment. Part vaudeville act, part laconic tall tale, the stories,
      with their dirty tricks and cunning plots, make you laugh out loud at the farce
      and snicker at the reversals. Like Grandma, the characters are larger-than-life
      funny, yet Peck is neither condescending nor picturesque. With the tall talk,
      irony, insult, and vulgarity, there's also a heartfelt sense of the Depression's
      time and place, when a knot of people wait outside the store for the day-old
      bread to become half price, and Grandma defies the sheriff, poaches catfish,
      and fries it up to feed the Depression drifters with her home-brewed beer ("They
      didn't thank her. She wasn't looking for thanks"). The viewpoint is adult--elderly
      Joe is looking back now at the changes he saw in those seven years--but many
      young people will recognize the irreverent, contrary voices of their own family
      legends across generations.

    - In a novel that skillfully captures the nuances of small-town life, an elderly
      man reminisces about his annual trips from Chicago to his grandmother's house
      in rural Illinois during the Depression. When the book opens, Joey and his sister,
      Mary Alice, nine and seven, respectively, learn that they will be spending a
      week every August with Grandma Dowdel. In eight vignettes, one for each summer
      from 1929 - 1935, with the final story set when Joey's troop train passes through
      in 1942, Peck (Strays Like Us, 1998) weaves a wry tale that ranges from humorous
      to poignant. Grandma Dowdel, with her gruff persona and pragmatic outlook on
      life, embodies not only the heart of a small town but the spirit of an era gone
      by. She turns the tables on a supercilious reporter from the big city, bests
      the local sheriff, feeds the drifters of the Depression, inspires a brawl between
      elderly (ancient) war heroes, and more. Peck deftly captures the feel of the
      times, from the sublime bliss of rooting around the ice bin at the local store
      for a nickel Nehi during the dog days of summer, to a thrilling flight in a
      biplane. Remarkable and fine.

      will turn him into a good boy.\" Such is the reigning philosophy at Camp Green
      Lake, a juvenile detention facility where there is no lake, and there are no
      happy campers. In place of what used to be \"the largest lake in Texas\" is
      now a dry, flat, sunburned wasteland, pocked with countless identical holes
      dug by boys improving their character. Stanley Yelnats, of palindromic name
      and ill-fated pedigree, has landed at Camp Green Lake because it seemed a better
      option than jail. No matter that his conviction was all a case of mistaken identity,
      the Yelnats family has become accustomed to a long history of bad luck, thanks
      to their \"no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather!\" Despite
      his innocence, Stanley is quickly enmeshed in the Camp Green Lake routine: rising
      before dawn to dig a hole five feet deep and five feet in diameter; learning
      how to get along with the Lord of the Flies-styled pack of boys in Group D;
      and fearing the warden, who paints her fingernails with rattlesnake venom. But
      when Stanley realizes that the boys may not just be digging to build character--that
      in fact the warden is seeking something specific--the plot gets as thick as
      the irony.\r\n\r\nIt's a strange story, but strangely compelling and lovely
      too. Louis Sachar uses poker-faced understatement to create a bizarre but believable
      landscape--a place where Major Major Major Major of Catch-22 would feel right
      at home. But while there is humor and absurdity here, there is also a deep understanding
      of friendship and a searing compassion for society's underdogs. As Stanley unknowingly
      begins to fulfill his destiny--the dual plots coming together to reveal that
      fate has big plans in store--we can't help but cheer for the good guys, and
      all the Yelnats everywhere."

    - Stanley Yelnats IV has been wrongly accused of stealing a famous baseball player's
      valued sneakers and is sent to Camp Green Lake, a juvenile detention home where
      the boys dig holes, five feet deep by five feet across, in the miserable Texas
      heat. It's just one more piece of bad luck that's befallen Stanley's family
      for generations as a result of the infamous curse of Madame Zeroni. Overweight
      Stanley, his hands bloodied from digging, figures that at the end of his sentence,
      he'll "...either be in great physical condition or else dead." Overcome by the
      useless work and his own feelings of futility, fellow inmate Zero runs away
      into the arid, desolate surroundings and Stanley, acting on impulse, embarks
      on a risky mission to save him. He unwittingly lays Madame Zeroni's curse to
      rest, finds buried treasure, survives yellow-spotted lizards, and gains wisdom
      and inner strength from the quirky turns of fate. In the almost mystical progress
      of their ascent of the rock edifice known as "Big Thumb," they discover their
      own invaluable worth and unwavering friendship. Each of the boys is painted
      as a distinct individual through Sachar's deftly chosen words. The author's
      ability to knit Stanley and Zero's compelling story in and out of a history
      of intriguing ancestors is captivating. Stanley's wit, integrity, faith, and
      wistful innocence will charm readers. A multitude of colorful characters coupled
      with the skillful braiding of ethnic folklore, American legend, and contemporary
      issues is a brilliant achievement. There is no question, kids will love Holes.

      and an overriding conflict between good and evil. The orphaned Baudelaire children,

      a drafty old house that teeters dangerously above the leech-filled Lake Lachrymose.

      pirate and a place called Curdled Cave. Children and fortunate adults will relish

    - This is "Book the Third" in a series about the wealthy and clever but unfortunate
      Baudelaire children who were orphaned in a tragic fire. Pursued by the evil
      Count Olaf, who murdered their parents and their last caregiver, 14-year-old
      Violet, 12-year-old Klaus, and baby Sunny are sent to elderly Aunt Josephine,
      a strange, fearful widow and grammarian. She lives in a house built on precarious
      stilts on the side of a hill overlooking Lake Lachrymose, inhabited by killer
      leeches. Of course, Count Olaf tracks them down and, disguised as a sailboat
      captain, fools Aunt Josephine-at least for a while. Olaf is ultimately exposed
      but not before he pushes Aunt Josephine into the leech-infested waters. So,
      the Baudelaires must find a new caregiver, who will be revealed to readers in
      "Book the Fourth." The writing is tongue-in-cheek John Bellairs, E. Nesbit,
      or Edward Eager with a little Norton Juster thrown in. The style is similar
      to the many books with old houses and rocky shores in Maine or Great Britain
      including the Edward Goreyesque illustrations. Unfortunately, the book misses
      the mark. The narrator is humorous but intrusive, explaining words and providing
      many obvious clues that surface later. Aunt Josephine's constant correction
      of vocabulary and grammar, while at first humorous, becomes annoying. The book
      is really not bad; it just tries too hard and there are so many similar books
      that are much better.

      Attean with tales from Robinson Crusoe, while in the afternoons, Attean teaches
      Matt about wilderness survival and Native American culture. The boys become
      friends in spite of themselves, and their inevitable parting is a moving tribute
      to the ability of shared experience to overcome prejudice. The Sign of the Beaver
      was a Newbery Honor Book; author Elizabeth Speare has also won the Newbery Medal
      twice, for The Witch of Blackbird Pond and The Bronze Bow.

    - Maniac Magee is a folk story about a boy, a very excitable boy. One that can
      outrun dogs, hit a home run off the best pitcher in the neighborhood, tie a
      knot no one can undo. "Kid's gotta be a maniac," is what the folks in Two Mills
      say. It's also the story of how this boy, Jeffrey Lionel "Maniac" Magee, confronts
      racism in a small town, tries to find a home where there is none and attempts
      to soothe tensions between rival factions on the tough side of town. Presented
      as a folk tale, it's the stuff of storytelling. "The history of a kid," says
      Jerry Spinelli, "is one part fact, two parts legend, and three parts snowball."
      And for this kid, four parts of fun. Maniac Magee won the 1991 Newbery Medal.

    - In this modern-day tall tale, Spinelli presents a humorous yet poignant look
      at the issue of race relations, a rare topic for a work aimed at middle readers.
      Orphaned as an infant, Jerry Magee is reared by his feuding aunt and uncle until
      he runs away at age eight. He finds his way to Two Mills, Pa., where the legend
      of "Maniac" Magee begins after he scores major upsets against Brian Denehy,
      the star high school football player, and Little League tough guy, John McNab.
      In racially divided Two Mills, the Beales, a black family, take Maniac in, but
      despite his local fame, community pressure forces him out and he returns to
      living at the zoo. Park groundskeeper Grayson next cares for the boy, but the
      old man dies and Maniac moves into the squalid home of the McNabs, who are convinced
      a race war is imminent. After a showdown with his nemesis, Mars Bar, Maniac
      bridges the gap between the two sides of town and finally finds a home. Full
      of snappy street-talk cadences, this off-the-wall yarn will give readers of
      all colors plenty of food for thought.

    - ! 'Warning: this interesting book is a mythical story about racism. It should
      not be read as reality. Legend springs up about Jeffrey "Maniac" Magee, a white
      boy who runs faster and hits balls farther than anyone, who lives on his own
      with amazing grace, and is innocent as to racial affairs. After running away
      from a loveless home, he encounters several families, in and around Two Mills,
      a town sharply divided into the black East End and the white West End. Black,
      feisty Amanda Beale and her family lovingly open their home to Maniac, and tough,
      smart-talking "Mars Bar" Thompson and other characters are all, to varying degrees,
      full of prejudices and unaware of their own racism. Racial epithets are sprinkled
      throught the book; Mars Bar calls Maniac "fishbelly," and blacks are described
      by a white character as being "today''s Indians." In the final, disjointed section
      of the book, Maniac confronts the hatred that perpetuates ignorance by bringing
      Mars Bar to meet the Pickwells--"the best the West End had to offer." In the
      feel-good ending, Mars and Maniac resolve their differences; Maniac gets a home
      and there is hope for at least improved racial relations. Unreal? Yes. It''s
      a cop-out for Spinelli to have framed this story as a legend--it frees him from
      having to make it real, or even possible. Nevertheless, the book will stimulate
      thinking about racism, and it might help educate those readers who, like so
      many students, have no first-hand knowledge of people of other races. Pathos
      and compassion inform a short, relatively easy-to-read story with broad appeal,
      which suggests that to solve problems of racism, people must first know each
      other as individuals.'

      survival. In 1942, 11-year-old Phillip Enright lives with his parents on the
      Dutch island of Curaçao, but when the war moves too close for comfort, his mother
      decides to travel with him back to the safety of Virginia. When their boat is
      torpedoed, however, Phillip is blinded and finds himself adrift on a life raft
      with an old black man and a cat. They eventually land on a deserted island.
      Phillip is suspicious of "the large Negro," but soon grows to trust--and ultimately
      love--the patient and generous Timothy. Dedicated to "Dr. King''s Dream," The
      Cay has a clear message that friendship is colorblind; it is also a terrific
      adventure story of a young, newly blinded man learning to survive on an uninhabited

      Americans across the United States before, during, and after the Civil Rights
      Movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Tillage describes the trials of sharecropping;
      trying to get an education in an inferior school; and walking a long distance
      to school while watching a bus full of white children pass him by. The author
      witnessed the murder of his father when a group of drunken white teenagers ran
      over the man. What price do you place on a human life? The father of the driver
      gave Mrs. Tillage 100 dollars and told his son to apologize. He never did. There
      was never any legal action taken. The events are succinctly and honestly expressed
      in the author''s first-person account. Roth''s monochromatic collage art, placed
      before the beginning of each chapter, documents the sparseness of Tillage''s
      life and its boundaries: home, church, school, work, and the balcony at the
      movie theater. The last story, "Marching," explains the role of many groups
      of southerners, representing a number of ethnic groups who supported and helped
      the marchers. The afterword and note about the genesis of the book are important

    - Tillage, a black custodian in a Baltimore private school, reminisces about his
      childhood as a sharecropper's son in the South, and his youth as a civil-rights
      protester. He explains the mechanics of sharecropping and segregation, tells
      of his mistreatment and his father's murder at the hands of white teenagers
      out to ``have some fun,'' and relates his experiences with police dogs, fire
      hoses, and jail while following Martin Luther King's ideas of nonviolent protest.
      Tillage matter-of-factly recounts horrific events, using spare language that
      is laced with remarkable wisdom, compassion, and optimism. Such gentleness only
      gives his story more power, as he drives home the harder realities of his childhood.
      Although the collage illustrations are interesting, they are too moody and remote
      for the human spirit behind the words, and readers will regret Roth's decision--especially
      in light of the boy smiling so brightly on the cover--that ``even one photo

      a girl she hardly knows and her twin sister to spend a week at grandmother's
      farm. When they finally come, Clara and Nettie, the more outgoing of the two,
      are drawn to each other. Patty, the shy twin, accepts this friendship and plays
      with Clara's younger siblings or entertains herself. Shortly after they return
      to school, Nettie is struck down by a cerebral hemorrhage. During the months
      she is in a coma, Patty and Clara comfort one another, but they realize that
      neither one can replace a best friend or beloved sister. When Nettie finally
      comes home, she slowly regains physical and some mental capabilities, but she
      is a shell of her former self. Clara invites her to the farm hoping to rekindle
      her spirit. Finally, her understanding mother and wise grandmother help Clara
      accept Nettie as she is. Although the medical problem here is severe and unusual,
      it serves to show how events can change friendships yet leave them still important
      and valued. This warm, tender first novel will touch the hearts of readers with
      its poignant theme of friendship found, lost, and regained.

      school years, . . . not one single teacher ever said to me, 'Perhaps you should
      consider becoming a writer,'\" Byars recalls. \"Anyway, I didn't want to be
      a writer. Writing seemed boring. You sat in a room all day by yourself and typed.
      If I was going to be a writer at all, I was going to be a foreign correspondent
      like Claudette Colbert in Arise My Love. I would wear smashing hats, wisecrack
      with the guys, and have a byline known round the world. My father wanted me
      to be a mathematician.\" So Byars set out to become mathematician, but when
      she couldn't grasp calculus in college, she turned to English. Even then, writing
      was not on her immediate horizon.\r\n\r\nFirst, she married and started a family.
      The writing career didn't emerge until she was 28, a mother of two children,
      and living in a small place she called the barracks apartment, in Urbana, Illinois.
      She and her husband, Ed, had moved there in 1956 so he could attend graduate
      school at the University of Illinois. She was bored, had no friends, and so
      turned to writing to fill her time. Byars started writing articles for The Saturday
      Evening Post, Look,and other magazines. As her family grew and her children
      started to read, she began to write books for young people and, fortunately
      for her readers, discovered that there was more to being a writer than sitting
      in front of a typewriter.\r\n\r\n\"Making up stories and characters is so interesting
      that I'm never bored. Each book has been a different writing experience. It
      takes me about a year to write a book, but I spend another year thinking about
      it, polishing it, and making improvements. I always put something of myself
      into my books -- something that happened to me. Once a wanderer came by my house
      and showed me how to brush my teeth with a cherry twig; that went in The House

      Salamanca Tree Hiddle's mother leaves home suddenly on a spiritual quest, vowing
      to return, but can't keep her promise. The girl and her father leave their farm
      in Kentucky and move to Ohio, where Sal meets Phoebe Winterbottom, also 13.
      While Sal accompanies her eccentric grandparents on a six-day drive to Idaho
      to retrace her mother's route, she entertains them with the tale of Phoebe,
      whose mother has also left home. While this story-within-a-story is a potentially
      difficult device, in the hands of this capable author it works well to create
      suspense, keep readers' interest, and draw parallels between the situations
      and reactions of the two girls. Sal's emotional journey through the grieving
      process-from denial to anger and finally to acceptance-is depicted realistically
      and with feeling. Indeed, her initial confusion and repression of the truth
      are mirrored in the book. Overall, a richly layered novel about real and metaphorical

      Morning, make a fresh start in Lucky Diggins, a town of mud, tents, and rough-hewn

      one case, teeth) of gold. Arvella eventually moves on, but Lucy has not only
      lost her desire to leave California, but found a vocation as well: town librarian.

      is the true gold to be found in California; Brother Claymore, a free-thinking
      minister who spreads his message of hope and inspiration beneath the canvas
      of a revival tent; and Snowshoe Ballou who finally leaves Lucky Diggins for
      the mountains with the following lament: "Mighty purty country once, afore it
      was fished and logged and mined to death." The two main characters are 12-years-old
      Lucy, who uses her considerable drive toward a much longed for return to the
      civilized world of her native New England, and Lucy''s widowed mother, Arvella,
      a down-to-earth pioneer with an unquenchable thirst for adventure. This is also
      a tale of two strong-willed women locked in a mother-daughter conflict. Cushman''s
      forceful writing combined with a narration in which the characters live and
      breathe make this a first choice for libraries.'

    - ! 'A peaceful, tropical world is the setting for Morning Girl, a simple yet
      rich glimpse into the lives of a young sister and brother. Morning Girl and
      Star Boy grapple with timeless, universal issues such as experiencing simultaneous
      anger and love toward family members and the quest to discover the true self.
      As all siblings do, these children respond to, play off of, and learn from each
      other. Precisely where Morning Girl and Star Boy are growing up is not revealed,
      but it''s clearly a place where the residents have no modern amenities. Living
      in harmony with nature is a necessary priority here, and--given the descriptive
      names of the characters--a Native Indian culture seems likely. But not until
      the epilogue do readers discover that the story takes place in 1492. Suddenly
      we realize that the strange-looking visitors Morning Girl welcomes to shore
      are not as harmless as they may appear. The excerpt from Christopher Columbus''s
      journal provides an ominous footnote: these gentle people, who seem so very
      much like us, will not be permitted their idyllic existence much longer. '

    - Miyax, like many adolescents, is torn. But unlike most, her choices may determine
      whether she lives or dies. At 13, an orphan, and unhappily married, Miyax runs
      away from her husband's parents' home, hoping to reach San Francisco and her
      pen pal. But she becomes lost in the vast Alaskan tundra, with no food, no shelter,
      and no idea which is the way to safety. Now, more than ever, she must look hard
      at who she really is. Is she Miyax, Eskimo girl of the old ways? Or is she Julie
      (her "gussak"-white people-name), the modernized teenager who must mock the
      traditional customs? And when a pack of wolves begins to accept her into their
      community, Miyax must learn to think like a wolf as well. If she trusts her
      Eskimo instincts, will she stand a chance of surviving?

      life after the ball isn''t necessarily lived happily ever after. Her prince
      is decidedly not charming, and castle life is cushy, but superficial and repressive.
      Then Ella meets tutor Jed Reston, a lively companion and social activist. Their
      relationship inspires her to rethink her wishes and priorities and to embark
      on a challenging quest to find true happiness in life and love. In lively prose,
      with well-developed characters, creative plot twists, wit, and drama, Haddix
      transforms the Cinderella tale into an insightful coming-of-age story. Ingenuity
      and determination, not magic wands, explain Ella''s gown, coach, and famous
      glass slippers, and lend credence to her adventures and evolving character.
      Easy to relate to, Ella is a strong female protagonist who learns the rewards
      of bettering life for others, and that happiness, like beauty, is in the eye

      of the glass slippers. In her version, Ella (sans \"Cinder\") finds her own
      way to the ball (there was no fairy godmother, despite the rumors) and wins
      the heart of the prince. But now she is finding that life at the palace as Prince
      Charming's betrothed is not as great as she thought it was going to be. In fact,
      it's downright boring for a self-reliant and active girl to do needlework all
      day or listen to instructions on court etiquette from the strict and cold Madame
      Bisset. Worst of all, Ella is beginning to suspect that Charming's beautiful
      blue eyes and golden hair are attached to a head with nothing in it. Her young
      tutor Jed, however, talks with her about serious things that really matter.
      Ella finally gets up the courage to announce to Charming that she doesn't want
      to go through with the wedding, but when she finds herself locked in the dungeon
      she realizes it's not that easy to walk away from a politically arranged marriage.
      In the end, as in all good fairy tales, our heroine and hero do manage to live
      happily ever after--but with a twist.\r\n\r\nFairy tale retellings are an entrancing
      form of young adult fiction, as they add psychological insight and turn events
      around for a surprising contemporary angle."

    - ! "Like the Oklahoma dust bowl from which she came, 14-year-old narrator Billie
      Jo writes in sparse, free-floating verse. In this compelling, immediate journal,
      Billie Jo reveals the grim domestic realities of living during the years of
      constant dust storms: That hopes--like the crops--blow away in the night like
      skittering tumbleweeds. That trucks, tractors, even Billie Jo's beloved piano,
      can suddenly be buried beneath drifts of dust. Perhaps swallowing all that grit
      is what gives Billie Jo--our strong, endearing, rough-cut heroine--the stoic
      courage to face the death of her mother after a hideous accident that also leaves
      her piano-playing hands in pain and permanently scarred.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Billie
      Jo's silent, windblown father is literally decaying with grief and skin cancer
      before her very eyes. When she decides to flee the lingering ghosts and dust
      of her homestead and jump a train west, she discovers a simple but profound
      truth about herself and her plight. There are no tight, sentimental endings
      here--just a steady ember of hope that brightens Karen Hesse's exquisitely written
      and mournful tale. Hesse won the 1998 Newbery Award for this elegantly crafted,
      gut-wrenching novel, and her fans won't want to miss The Music of Dolphins or
      Letters from Rifka."

    - Fourteen-year-old Billie Jo's life is defined by struggle both physical and
      emotional. She struggles to forgive her father for causing the accident that
      killed her mother. She fights a daily battle to survive during the worst days
      of the Oklahoma dust storms. And she strives to heal her body and her soul when
      severe burns leave her disfigured and unable to play the music she loves. Set
      during the time of the Great Depression and written in free verse, Karen Hesse's
      spare but powerful work (Scholastic, 1997) captures every nuance of Billie Jo's
      emotions, from heartwrenching sadness at the death of her mother and newborn
      brother to the challenge of rebuilding a relationship with her embittered father.
      Read with disarming simplicity and straightforwardness by Marika Mashburn, an
      Oklahoma native, the titled and dated entries span the course of a year during
      which Billie Jo's reflections lead her to draw on qualities she never knew she
      possessed. Powerful and moving, this 1998 Newbery Medal winner is a recommended
      purchase for all school and public libraries.

      dies after a gruesome accident caused by her father''s leaving a bucket of kerosene
      near the stove; Billie Jo is partially responsible--fully responsible in the
      eyes of the community--and sustains injuries that seem to bring to a halt her
      dreams of playing the piano. Finding a way through her grief is not made easier
      by her taciturn father, who went on a drinking binge while Billie Joe''s mother,
      not yet dead, begged for water. Told in free-verse poetry of dated entries that
      span the winter of 1934 to the winter of 1935, this is an unremittingly bleak
      portrait of one corner of Depression-era life. In Billie Jo, the only character
      who comes to life, Hesse (The Music of Dolphins, 1996, etc.) presents a hale
      and determined heroine who confronts unrelenting misery and begins to transcend
      it. The poem/novel ends with only a trace of hope; there are no pat endings,

    - Katie's first word is "kira-kira," the Japanese word for "glittering," and she
      uses it to describe everything she likes. It was taught to her by her older
      sister, Lynn, whom Katie worships. Both girls have trouble adjusting when their
      parents move the family from Iowa to a small town in rural Georgia, where they
      are among only 31 Japanese-Americans. They seldom see their parents, who have
      grueling jobs in chicken-processing plants. Then Lynn becomes deathly ill, and
      Katie is often left to care for her, a difficult and emotionally devastating
      job. When her sister dies of lymphoma, Katie searches for ways to live up to
      her legacy and to fulfill the dreams she never had a chance to attain. Told
      from Katie's point of view and set in the 1950s, this beautifully written story
      tells of a girl struggling to find her own way in a family torn by illness and
      horrendous work conditions. Katie's parents can barely afford to pay their daughter's
      medical bills, yet they refuse to join the growing movement to unionize until
      after Lynn's death. All of the characters are believable and well developed,
      especially Katie, who acts as a careful observer of everything that happens
      in her family, even though there is a lot she doesn't understand. Especially
      heartbreaking are the weeks leading up to Lynn's death, when Katie is exhausted
      and frustrated by the demands of her sister's illness, yet willing to do anything
      to make her happy. Girls will relate to and empathize with the appealing protagonist.--Ashley

    - Katie Takeshima worships her older sister, Lynn, who knows everything and takes
      care of Katie while their parents are working long hours in their small Georgia
      town in the late 1950s. It's Lynn who shows Katie the glittering beauty (kira-kira)
      of the stars and who prepares Katie for the prejudice she will encounter as
      one of the few Japanese American kids in their school. But when Katie is 10,
      Lynn, 14, falls ill, and everything changes. Slowly the roles are reversed;
      Katie becomes caregiver and does what Lynn has taught her. There's no surprise.
      It's clear that Lynn will die, and Katie goes through all the stages of grief.
      The real story is in the small details, never self-consciously "poetic" but
      tense with family drama. In her first novel for young people, Kadohata stays
      true to the child's viewpoint in plain, beautiful prose that can barely contain
      the passionate feelings. Just as heart wrenching as the sisters' story is what
      Katie knows of her father's struggle, whether it's his backbreaking work in
      the factory or his love for his family. The quiet words will speak to readers
      who have lost someone they love--or fear that they could. Hazel Rochman

      father was a reporter and her mother had studied to be a pianist, and their
      house was always full of musicians and theater people. L’Engle graduated cum
      laude from Smith College, then returned to New York to work in the theater.
      While touring with a play, she wrote her first book, The Small Rain, originally

      appeared in The Cherry Orchard.\r\n \r\nUpon becoming Mrs. Franklin, L’Engle
      gave up the stage in favor of the typewriter. In the years her three children
      were growing up, she wrote four more novels. Hugh Franklin temporarily retired
      from the theater, and the family moved to western Connecticut and for ten years
      ran a general store. Her book Meet the Austins, an American Library Association

      Carson and Singing Wind, an Arapaho Indian woman. When Adaline's mother dies
      and her father leaves on an expedition through the Rockies, the 11-year-old
      is sent to live with Kit's cousins in St. Louis. Mistreated and misunderstood
      in "the land of apples and book-larnin'," Adaline flees and, accompanied only
      by a mongrel dog, sets off in search of her father, who has mysteriously failed
      to return. Attracted to both free roaming and what she calls "the Fruits of
      Civilization," Adaline is a child of two very different and often conflicting
      worlds. Osborne does a good job of dramatizing this life story, which is not
      only a quest for a missing father but also a search for personal identity. Told
      in the girl's colorful frontier voice, this is an engaging tale of true grit
      and self-discovery. An author's note describes Osborne's sources for this fictionalized
      account. Michael Cart

    - ! "Legendary scout Kit Carson's sassy daughter Adaline, or Falling Star, as
      her Arapaho mother called her before succumbing to cholera, is mute with grief.
      Her widowed father has left her with his racist, cruel relatives until he returns
      from his Rocky Mountain expedition. But her cousins' treatment of her is more
      than she can bear. Instead of allowing her to go to school, they force her to
      work as a servant in the schoolhouse. Due to her \"half-breed\" status, she
      is barely considered human. Her mixed heritage causes her plenty of internal
      confusion, as well.\r\n\r\n    \"I'm a mix, I reckon, of white and red blood,
      and also a jumbled love for free roaming and the Fruits of Civilization, which
      is what Doc Hempstead calls reading, writing, and geography.\" \r\n\r\nAdaline's
      intelligence and sensitivity keep her alive when her impulsiveness provokes
      her to run away to find her father. Her bravery and gritty frontier resourcefulness
      rival her father's, but her compassion is all her own.\r\n\r\nIn this lively
      and touching account, Mary Pope Osborne has fictionalized the life of Kit Carson's
      real but little-known daughter. Osborne is the renowned author of the very popular
      Magic Tree House series, as well as many other books for children and young
      adults, including a collection of yarns about American folk heroes called American
      Tall Tales.- Emilie Coulter"

    - This historical novel set at the beginning of the Civil War actually opens in
      1916, as 15-year-old Howard Leland Hutchings recounts his trip in a Model T
      to visit his father's childhood home in Grand Tower, IL. When he and his younger
      brothers meet the four elderly people who raised their father, the novel shifts
      to 1861, and the narrator shifts to 15-year-old Tilly Pruitt, the boys' grandmother.
      When a steamboat from New Orleans brings two mysterious young ladies, Mama offers
      them room and board, and the Pruitts' lives are forever changed. Fair and beautiful
      Delphine Duval, with her fancy dresses and high-society ways, fascinates the
      family. And what of Calinda, the darker-skinned young woman? Could she be Delphine's
      slave? On the eve of his 16th birthday, Tilly's twin brother, Noah, leaves to
      join the Union troops at Camp Defiance and Mama, distraught, sends Tilly and
      Delphine to bring him home. It is here that Tilly learns of Delphine's heritage.
      She is a quadroon, part of the colored family of a rich white man. Her mother
      sent her daughters away from New Orleans, hoping Delphine can pass for white.
      The novel ends with a return to 1916 and Howard's finding out his father's true
      parentage. In this thoroughly researched novel, Peck masterfully describes the
      female Civil War experience, the subtle and not-too-subtle ways the country
      was changing, and the split in loyalty that separated towns and even families.
      Although the book deals with some weighty themes, it is not without humor. A
      scene involving strapping on a corset is worthy of Grandma Dowdel herself.

    - Ryan uses the experiences of her own Mexican grandmother as the basis for this
      compelling story of immigration and assimilation, not only to a new country
      but also into a different social class. Esperanza's expectation that her 13th
      birthday will be celebrated with all the material pleasures and folk elements
      of her previous years is shattered when her father is murdered by bandits. His
      powerful stepbrothers then hold her mother as a social and economic hostage,
      wanting to force her remarriage to one of them, and go so far as to burn down
      the family home. Esperanza's mother then decides to join the cook and gardener
      and their son as they move to the United States and work in California's agricultural
      industry. They embark on a new way of life, away from the uncles, and Esperanza
      unwillingly enters a world where she is no longer a princess but a worker. Set
      against the multiethnic, labor-organizing era of the Depression, the story of
      Esperanza remaking herself is satisfyingly complete, including dire illness
      and a difficult romance. Except for the evil uncles, all of the characters are
      rounded, their motives genuine, with class issues honestly portrayed. Easy to

    - ! "\"She was homeschooling gone amok.\" \"She was an alien.\" \"Her parents
      were circus acrobats.\" These are only a few of the theories concocted to explain
      Stargirl Caraway, a new 10th grader at Arizona's Mica Area High School who wears
      pioneer dresses and kimonos to school, strums a ukulele in the cafeteria, laughs
      when there are no jokes, and dances when there is no music. The whole school,
      not exactly a \"hotbed of nonconformity,\" is stunned by her, including our
      16-year-old narrator Leo Borlock: \"She was elusive. She was today. She was
      tomorrow. She was the faintest scent of a cactus flower, the flitting shadow
      of an elf owl.\"\r\n\r\nIn time, incredulity gives way to out-and-out adoration
      as the student body finds itself helpless to resist Stargirl's wide-eyed charm,
      pure-spirited friendliness, and penchant for celebrating the achievements of
      others. In the ultimate high school symbol of acceptance, she is even recruited
      as a cheerleader. Popularity, of course, is a fragile and fleeting state, and
      bit by bit, Mica sours on their new idol. Why is Stargirl showing up at the
      funerals of strangers? Worse, why does she cheer for the opposing basketball
      teams? The growing hostility comes to a head when she is verbally flogged by
      resentful students on Leo's televised Hot Seat show in an episode that is too
      terrible to air. While the playful, chin-held-high Stargirl seems impervious
      to the shunning that ensues, Leo, who is in the throes of first love (and therefore
      scornfully deemed \"Starboy\"), is not made of such strong stuff: \"I became
      angry. I resented having to choose. I refused to choose. I imagined my life
      without her and without them, and I didn't like it either way.\"\r\n\r\nJerry
      Spinelli, author of Newbery Medalist Maniac Magee, Newbery Honor Book Wringer,
      and many other excellent books for teens, elegantly and accurately captures
      the collective, not-always-pretty emotions of a high school microcosm in which
      individuality is pitted against conformity. Spinelli's Stargirl is a supernatural
      teen character--absolutely egoless, altruistic, in touch with life's primitive
      rhythms, meditative, untouched by popular culture, and supremely self-confident.
      It is the sensitive Leo whom readers will relate to as he grapples with who
      she is, who he is, who they are together as Stargirl and Starboy, and indeed,
      what it means to be a human being on a planet that is rich with wonders.- Karin

    - Belle Prater becomes the stuff of local legend in Coal Station, Virginia, when
      she disappears, leaving everyone mystified. Because his father drinks, Belle's
      boy, cross-eyed Woodrow, comes to live with his grandparents on the finest residential
      street in town; and 12-year-old Gypsy, his cousin who lives next door and narrates
      the story, is glad to get to know him. Like everyone else, she is curious about
      his mother; but Woodrow will only tell her a fantastic story about a magical
      place. Nevertheless, the girl comes to admire her cousin for the way he uses
      his superior intelligence and pleasant personality to adapt to a more affluent
      life, fend off rude questions about his mother, and handle the local bully.
      Gypsy seems to lead an idyllic life, but when a schoolmate puts a face on her
      recurring nightmare, she collapses in the rush of long-repressed sorrow. White
      paints a vivid picture of small town Appalachia in the 1950s, from the ostracism
      of a blind "sin eater" to the preening of social "wannabes." Characterization
      is superb. Gypsy's evolving understanding of her late father's values and her
      stepfather's virtues is especially well done. White's message-that there is
      no protection for any of us from pain, only a variety of ways to handle it-
      is delivered with just right dollops of humor and love. What's important, as
      Gypsy's grandmother puts it, is to let our true selves shine. A delightful read

      door, Gypsy thinks she'll get on the inside track of a family mystery, the disappearance
      of Woodrow's mother. Gypsy soon learns, however, that Woodrow isn't talking,
      so she begins concentrating, instead, on his thoughtful nature, puckish charm,
      and talent for telling grand stories. It's only during odd moments that Gypsy
      catches a glimpse of Woodrow's real sadness, but to push him to talk about his
      mother before he's ready might mean Gypsy would have to face up to a painful
      secret of her own. Several themes neatly dovetail in this unpretentious, moving
      story set in Appalachia in the 1950s. Humor and insight infuse a solid picture
      of small-town life as two strongly depicted young characters uncover an important
      truth some grown-ups never learn. Stephanie Zvirin

      as appealing as tango dancing. The one person who understands how the little
      boy feels is his grandmother Hannah, who loves to dance the tango and expresses
      joy in whatever she does. She tells him, "You'll be great at whatever you do.
      Like I am. You should see me dance." When she twists her ankle and needs cheering
      up, the boy moves in for a week. He teaches her how to catch a fly ball; she
      plays the piano, which inspires the boy to learn a song and discover that maybe
      there is more to life than baseball. The book's colorful illustrations are subtly

      that children--boys, especially--need their artistic sides affirmed. A fine

      is performing to beat the band, acting out the various accidents behind his
      back. Things are swell until a news team videotapes Buckle and his amazing sidekick

      and canine both struggle to rouse themselves, eat breakfast from bowls, and
      have an intimate knowledge of their route. Pilkey paints their shared experiences
      with a graceful economy of language. Morning is the third character in the story?"...this
      is the time when they are the happiest." Deep, sumptuous acrylics portray the
      initial darkness, the gradual lightening, and the riotous magenta and orange
      sunrise. The artist has cleverly designed parallel, yet contrasting, opening
      and closing scenes of the African American child in bed, feet covered by his
      dog, room framed by a sloping roof. In the first spread, the still starry morning
      surrounds the house and "enters" it through the uncurtained window. When the
      duo return and crawl back into bed, the shade is pulled against the brilliance,
      the room darkened?a scene clinching their camaraderie. A totally satisfying
      story for small groups or individuals.

      eat their breakfasts, and deliver the newspapers. Riding his bike along the
      delivery route, the boy thinks about "Big Things. And small things. And sometimes
      he is thinking about nothing at all." Meanwhile, his dog travels the same route
      in his own way: "He knows which trees are for sniffing. He knows which birdbaths
      are for drinking, which squirrels are for chasing, and which cats are for growling
      at." Happy together before the rest of the world awakes, they finish the job
      and head back home to bed, where they dream of flying across the night sky.
      The story tells the details of a paperboy''s morning in a matter-of-fact way,
      and young children will find those details fascinating: the wordless pages that
      show how the papers arrive at the boy''s house; the paperboy snapping the green
      rubber bands around the rolled newspapers; and the empty red bag flapping behind
      the boy as he pedals home. The dual story of boy and dog adds dimension throughout
      and leads to a satisfying conclusion, but just as important is the sense of
      time passing within the story and the artwork. Using simplified shapes and muted
      colors shot with light, the acrylic paintings include beautifully composed landscapes
      and interiors, ending with a Chagall-like dream scene on the last page. An evocative
      mood piece, this captures the elusive feeling of being outside before dawn.

    - Bud, 10, is on the run from the orphanage and from yet another mean foster family.
      His mother died when he was 6, and he wants to find his father. Set in Michigan
      during the Great Depression, this is an Oliver Twist kind of foundling story,
      but it's told with affectionate comedy. On his journey, Bud finds danger and
      violence (most of it treated as farce), but more often, he finds kindness--in
      the food line, in the library, in the Hooverville squatter camp, on the road--until
      he discovers who he is and where he belongs. Told in the boy's naive, desperate
      voice, with lots of examples of his survival tactics ("Rules and Things for
      Having a Funner Life and Making a Better Liar out of Yourself"), this will make
      a great read-aloud. Curtis says in an afterword that some of the characters
      are based on real people, including his own grandfathers, so it's not surprising
      that the rich blend of tall tale, slapstick, sorrow, and sweetness has the wry,
      teasing warmth of family folklore.

      His mother died when he was 6, and he wants to find his father. Set in Michigan
      during the Great Depression, this is an Oliver Twist kind of foundling story,
      but it's told with affectionate comedy. On his journey, Bud finds danger and
      violence (most of it treated as farce), but more often, he finds kindness--in
      the food line, in the library, in the Hooverville squatter camp, on the road--until
      he discovers who he is and where he belongs. Told in the boy's naive, desperate
      voice, with lots of examples of his survival tactics ("Rules and Things for
      Having a Funner Life and Making a Better Liar out of Yourself"), this will make
      a great read-aloud. Curtis says in an afterword that some of the characters
      are based on real people, including his own grandfathers, so it's not surprising
      that the rich blend of tall tale, slapstick, sorrow, and sweetness has the wry,
      teasing warmth of family folklore.

    - This warm, charming look at a small bear's fear of the dark is right on target
      for the preschool set. As Big Bear sits by the cozy fire trying to read, Little
      Bear, frightened of ``the dark all around us,'' cannot fall asleep. Sympathetic
      Big Bear lights lanterns in several sizes, attempting to banish the dark from
      the corners of their cave, but Little Bear wants more. Finally, when he is taken
      outside, cuddled close, and shown a full moon and twinkling stars, sleep comes
      instantly. Big Bear's compassion for his small charge is most evident in his
      loving facial expressions and in the warmth of the full-page watercolor and
      soft pencil illustrations. Blue arched borders around pages showing indoor scenes
      give the impression of looking into the cave from the dark outside; they provide
      a clear contrast to the wide-open snowy woodland settings at the book's beginning
      and end. Little Bear is the epitome of everychild, persistently (but endearingly)
      pestering for a little more attention and one last hug. The soft banter between
      the two characters, combined with a touch of repetitive phrasing, add to the
      book's strong child appeal. It's bound to become a beloved bedtime ritual in
      many households.

    - Gammell's animated, crisp, colored pencil line drawings enhance this story of
      Grandpa, who was famous for his vaudeville song and dance. Clever details of
      his and his grandchildrens' personalities are consciously delineated as he now
      performs on his attic stage. The shadow and the performer, transformed by his
      art, complement the text tenderly. The spirit of song and dance are reflected
      in the careful placement of drawings and text; five times they stretch voluminously
      across double-page spreads, although the text is always legible. It is also
      poetic at times. The accurate depiction of old age and the magic of the theater
      rhythmically combine like a dance with a solid beginning, middle, and end. It
      offers enchantment for children and for the person of any age who reads it to
      them. In its entirety, this glimpse into a unique, artistic personality offers
      a sweet reminder of the joy in the diversity of people. In boldness, realism,
      and linear strength, the illustrations are reminiscent of Steig's Amos and Boris
      (Farrar, 1971), which is also about individuality and acceptance. However, the
      persistence of memory and the acceptance of individuality are sophisticated
      concepts. The book's only weakness is that it may too often be set aside by
      adults looking for something easier to digest.

      children can count on complications and, of course, a happy ending. After climbing
      a ladder at a nearby building site to get a better look at his new garden plot,
      Paddington returns to the ground to find a pile of concrete on the spot where
      he had left his precious jar of marmalade. The workers are helpful, but the
      result is a pile of chunky, golden concrete lumps. Inspired by the materials
      at hand, Paddington plants a rock garden and wins a gold star. Young children
      who have enjoyed the previous picture books from Bond and Alley will find this
      mild adventure as enjoyable as the rest. Alley's endearing ink-and-watercolor
      illustrations offer expressive drawings in pleasing colors and plenty of diverting

      their images singing forth in glorious color, dramatically contrasted with the

    - Inspired by the snows of Alaska, Carlstrom has written a hauntingly beautiful
      homage to winter. In answer to his child's questions, a father describes the
      season in lively and wondrous terms, conjuring up an image of winter as a woman.
      "Does winter have fingers? Yes, her frosty grip will tire the flowers." "Does
      winter have feet? Yes, sometimes at night winter dances on top of the roof."
      As the two stand together beneath a star-lit sky, wild geese fly overhead, a
      symbol of the departing autumn, and the intensity of this magical moment shared
      between them is tangible. Young's paintings, in predominantly somber tones infused
      with flashes of color, are striking. Misty landscapes, a shrouded moon, a goose
      in flight--each spread is complete in itself, as a moment is captured and winter's
      silent majesty evoked. Some illustrations are difficult to puzzle out, yet they
      are captivating in their originality and their use of color and texture. Despite
      the frostiness of the subject, text and art create a warmhearted book to be
      lovingly shared by parents and children.

      the excitement of the changing seasons. Using a question-and-answer format that
      moves from the concrete to the abstract, Carlstrom poetically explores the mysteries
      of winter: "Does winter have fingers?/ Yes, her frosty grip will tire the flowers./
      Winter puts the whole garden to bed and covers it/with a fresh white blanket."
      This leads naturally into the next query, "Does winter have hands?" creating
      a balanced structure that allows the text to flow smoothly and logically. Working
      with colors ranging from warm burnt orange to crisp and icy shades of blue and
      green, Young masterfully moves his illustrations from fall to winter, paralleling
      the action of the text. Images from the poem are subtly evoked, encouraging
      imaginative interpretation from viewers. While some concepts may be too sophisticated
      for younger children, this book succeeds in combining words and pictures that
      capture the power and majesty of nature.'

      and the cold. As she travels from the duck pond to the hilltop, she finds the
      other animals agree with her parents - a tortoise out in winter is ridiculous.
      And so Shelley decides to return home - and gets there much quicker than a tortoise
      can normally travel! Playful artwork perfectly sets the tone in this lighthearted
      story.

    - Cooney's ongoing fascination with family ties and elder/younger relationships
      and her keen awareness of the interdependence of all people and their living
      styles are newly expressed in Island Boy. She steers her lyrical, lengthy illustrated
      story with confidence through four generations on a New England coastal island.
      Pa, Ma, and their 12 children settle the island. When he's ready, young Matthais
      sails with his uncle's schooner, first as cabin boy and 15 years later, as master.
      Finally acting on the pull of island memories, Matthais returns and soon marries
      Hannah, a schoolmistress from Boston. Matthais stays on Tibbetts Island after
      their three girls grow up and leave, and after Hannah's death. One year, his
      daughter Annie and her son join Matthais, until Matthais' accidental death.
      The text is occasionally poetic, with satisfyingly repetitive references to
      the astrakhan tree and the wild bird, for example, which underscore the book's
      continuity. Cooney's palette ranges from the clear greens and blues of the island
      and the water to the browns she employs effectively for domestic interiors and
      city street scenes. Her humans have individual characteristics. An endpaper
      map and a well-designed title page introduce this resolutely beautiful account
      of the interconnectedness of generations and lifestyles. Cooney's flawless transitions
      between the generations and between third-person points of view always maintain
      a child's perspective. Island Boy is certain to be a favorite for family sharing,
      as well as a must for school and public libraries. Teachers will love it; buy
      extra copies.

    - This timeless Dr. Seuss classic was first published in 1960, and has been delighting
      readers ever since. Sam-I-am is as persistent as a telemarketer, changing as
      many variables as possible in the hopes of convincing the nameless skeptic that
      green eggs and ham are a delicacy to be savored. He tries every manner of presentation
      with this "nouveau cuisine"--in a house, with a mouse, in a box, with a fox,
      with a goat, on a boat--to no avail. Then finally, finally the doubter caves
      under the tremendous pressure exerted by the tireless Sam-I-am. And guess what?
      Well, you probably know what happens, but even after reading Green Eggs and
      Ham the thousandth time, the climactic realization that green eggs and ham are
      "so good, so good, you see" is still a rush. As usual, kids will love Dr. Seuss's
      wacky rhymes and whimsical illustrations--and this time, they might even be
      so moved as to finally take a taste of their broccoli.

    - ! "Dr. Seuss was born Theodor Geisel in Springfield, Massachusetts on March
      2, 1904. After attending Dartmouth College and Oxford University, he began a
      career in advertising. His advertising cartoons, featuring Quick, Henry, the
      Flit!, appeared in several leading American magazines. Dr. Seuss's first children's
      book, And To Think That I Saw It On Mulberry Street, hit the market in 1937,
      and the world of children's literature was changed forever! In 1957, Seuss's
      The Cat in the Hat became the prototype for one of Random House's best- selling
      series, Beginner Books. This popular series combined engaging stories with outrageous
      illustrations and playful sounds to teach basic reading skills. Brilliant, playful,
      and always respectful of children, Dr. Seuss charmed his way into the consciousness
      of four generations of youngsters and parents. In the process, he helped kids
      learn to read.\r\n\r\nWinner of the Pulitzer Prize in 1984 and three Academy
      Awards, Seuss was the author and illustrator of 44 children's books, some of
      which have been made into audiocassettes, animated television specials, and
      videos for children of all ages. Even after his death in 1991, Dr. Seuss continues
      to be the best-selling author of children's books in the world. "

    - ! "Don Freeman was born in San Diego, California, in 1908. At an early age,
      he received a trumpet as a gift from his father. He practiced obsessively and
      eventually joined a California danceband. After graduating from high school,
      he ventured to New York City to study art under the tutelage of Joan Sloan and
      Harry Wickey at the Art Students' League. He managed to support himself throughout
      his schooling by playing his trumpet evenings, in nightclubs and at weddings.\r\n\r\nGradually,
      he eased into making a living sketching impressions of Broadway shows for The
      New York Times and The Herald Tribune. This shift was helped along, in no small
      part, by a rather heartbreaking incident; he lost his trumpet. One evening,
      he was so engrossed in sketching people on the subway, he simply forgot it was
      sitting on the seat beside him. This new career turned out to be a near-perfect
      fit for Don, though, as he had always loved the theater.\r\n\r\nHe was introduced
      to the world of Childrens' Literature, when William Saroyan asked him to illustrate
      several books. Soon after, he began to write and illustrate his own books, a
      career he settled into comfortably and happily. Through his writing, he was
      able to create his own theater: \"I love the flow of turning the pages, the
      suspense of what's next. Ideas just come at me and after me. It's all so natural.
      I work all the time, long into the night, and it's such a pleasure. I don't
      know when the time ends. I've never been happier in my life!\"\r\n\r\nDon died
      in 1978, after a long and successful career. He created many beloved characters
      in his lifetime, perhaps the most beloved among them a stuffed, overall-wearing
      bear, named Corduroy.\r\n\r\nDon Freeman was the author and illustrator of many
      popular books for children, including Corduroy, A Pocket for Corduroy, and the
      Caldecott Honor Book Fly High, Fly Low. For more information about Don Freeman,

      said her name was perfect. But on the first day of school, Chrysanthemum begins
      to suspect that her name is far less than perfect, especially when her class
      dissolves into giggles upon hearing her name read aloud. That evening, Chrysanthemum's
      parents try to piece her self-esteem back together again with comfort food and
      a night filled \"with hugs, kisses, and Parcheesi.\" But the next day Victoria,
      a particularly observant and mean-spirited classmate, announces that Chrysanthemum's
      name takes up 13 letters. \"That's half the letters in the alphabet!\" she adds.
      Chrysanthemum wilts. Pretty soon the girls are making playground threats to
      \"pluck\" Chrysanthemum and \"smell her.\"\r\n\r\nKevin Henkes has great compassion
      for the victims of childhood teasing and cruelties--using fresh language, endearing
      pen-and-ink mouse characters, and realistic dialogue to portray real-life vulnerability.
      He also has great compassion for parents, offering several adult-humor jokes
      for anxious mommies and daddies. On the surface, the finale is overly tidy and
      the coincidences unbelievable. But in the end, what sustains Chrysanthemum,
      as well as this story, is the steadfast love and support of her family. And
      because of this, the closure is ultimately convincing and utterly comforting."

    - She was a perfect baby, and her doting parents chose a name to match, Chrysanthemum.
      She is proud of her musical name until kindergarten, when she finds herself
      in a world of strange new names such as Sue, Bill, Max, Sam, and Joe--in short
      ( really short) a world of ordinary monikers. That wouldn't be so bad if the
      others--like Victoria--hadn't made a mean-spirited game of tormenting her, sending
      her home in tears to be comforted with cuddles and Parcheesi. Wisely, Chrysanthemum's
      concerned and loving parents try not to interfere, but what can't be put right
      by them is dealt with by lucky chance. The class learns that their popular music
      teacher not only has a whopper of a name herself--Delphinium--but also plans
      to name her expected baby by the prettiest name she has heard, Chrysanthemum.
      The charming mouse with her delicate little face seems just right for her name.
      The range of expression and emotion Henkes conveys in his pen-and-ink and watercolor
      illustrations are "absolutely perfect." The impressionistic floral backdrops
      and patterning reinforce the story's lighthearted, yet tender theme. This sensitive
      story will strike a chord with young children, particularly those who also have
      difficult or unfamiliar names.

      wonderful teacher, Mr. Slinger. One morning Lilly is happier than ever because
      her grandmother has given her movie star sunglasses, three shiny quarters, and
      a purple plastic purse that plays a tune when it''s opened. She''s dying to
      show her new things to her friends. But when she talks out of turn and distracts

      with some snacks: ``Today was a difficult day./Tomorrow will be better.''''
      Helped by her parents, a remorseful Lilly manages a heartwarming reconciliation
      with her teacher. Henkes once again demonstrates his direct line to the roller-
      coaster emotions of small children. With a slightly more complicated plot than
      those of Lilly''s previous adventures, this one employs understated humor throughout.

      with excitement, flashes with anger, wanes in remorse, and leaps right off the

      food. But most of all, she loves her teacher, Mr. Slinger, who is a sharp dresser
      and greets his students with an uncharacteristic "Howdy." The little mouse will
      do anything for him, until he refuses to allow her to interrupt lessons to show
      the class her new movie-star sunglasses, three shiny quarters, and purple plastic
      purse. Seething with anger, she writes a mean story about him and places it
      in his book bag at the end of the day. But when she looks in her purse, she
      discovers that he has written her a kind note and even left her a bag of treats.
      Filled with remorse, Lilly sets out to make amends. Rich vocabulary and just
      the right amount of repetition fuse perfectly with the watercolor and black-pen
      illustrations. With a few deft strokes, Henkes changes Lilly's facial expressions
      and body language to reveal a full range of emotions. When she realizes how
      unfair she has been, Lilly shrinks smaller and smaller. When all ends well,
      she leaps for joy in her familiar red boots right out of the picture's frame.
      Clever dialogue and other funny details will keep readers looking and laughing.
      As the cover and end papers attest, Lilly emerges once again a star.

    - ! "In this quietly affecting story, award-winning author Karen Hesse and artist
      Jon J. Muth deftly capture the magnificence of a sudden rainstorm on a swelteringly
      hot day. Much more than a simple tale of weather, Come On, Rain! also portrays
      the tenderness of mother-daughter relations, the rhythms of urban society, and
      the power of nature to transform and reinvigorate all forms of life.\r\n\r\nThe
      book's collaborators, more like alchemists, work wonders. Muth's sunbaked watercolors
      perfectly convey the washed-out, drought-stricken world, while Hesse's gripping
      narrative--a detailed prose poem written in the voice of the watchful, pigtailed
      Tessie--conveys undaunted hope and anticipation. Like a long-limbed little bird--all
      twiggy arms and legs--Tessie moves through the neighborhood, observing her Mamma,
      her friends, the skies, even the streets:\r\n\r\n    Up and down the block,\r\n
      \   cats pant,\r\n    heat wavers off tar patches in the broiling alleyway....\r\n\r\n
      \   I stare out over rooftops,\r\n    past chimneys, into the way off distance.\r\n
      \   And that's when I see it coming,\r\n    clouds rolling in,\r\n    gray clouds,
      bunched and bulging under a purple sky.\r\n\r\n    A creeper of hope circles
      round my bones.\r\n    \"Come on, rain!\" I whisper.\r\n\r\nAs the downpour
      approaches, Tessie gathers her neighborhood friends for a romp in the raindrops.
      Their eager anticipation is matched by a rain shower so gigantic, it even makes
      their mothers run into the street. It's literally the stuff that dreams are
      made of--my own daughter dreamed of the delicious downpour the night we first
      read the book."

    - Hesse hits some high notes in this story of parched summer days in the city.
      Young Tess watches as her mother tends to her woeful wilting vegetable patch;
      the heat is enveloping. Tess, from her perch on the fire escape, scans the sky
      in hopes of deliverance, and sure enough, those are rain clouds she spies. When
      the clouds break, everyone steps joyfully to the rain dance. Hesse's language
      is a quiet, elegant surge--`` `Rain's coming, Mamma,' I say. Mamma turns to
      the window and sniffs. `It's about time,' she murmurs,'' but it can become ornate
      (``trinkets of silver rain'' and music that ``streaks like night lightning'')
      and jarring amid the contained beauty of the rest of the writing. Muth contributes
      fine watercolor atmospherics, in sultry summer scenes where the heat is almost
      palpable, and raucous wet scenes of jubilant dancers.

    - This is the first volume in a planned trilogy about Merlin's youth, an area
      generally ignored in traditional Merlin lore. Barron has certainly come up with
      an intriguing perspective of what he calls Merlin's lost years, as told by the
      future wizard himself. A boy, hurled on the rocks by the sea, regains consciousness
      unable to remember anything--not his parents, not his own name. He is sure that
      the secretive Branwen is not his mother, despite her claims, and that Emrys
      is not his real name. The two soon find themselves feared because of Branwen's
      healing abilities and Emrys' growing powers, and when they are attacked, Emrys
      strikes out, causing an inferno that blinds him when he plunges into the fire
      to rescue his antagonist. Branwen and Emrys are taken in by nuns, and as Emrys
      despairs and heals, he discovers yet another talent--that of second sight--which
      enables him to embark on a quest to find his true name and heritage. His journey
      leads him back across the sea to the isle of Fincayra, a mysterious land "not
      of the Earth, nor of the Otherworld." There he joins forces with the forest
      girl Rhia and the heroic little giant Shim to battle the evil Rhita Gawr, whose
      blight is destroying the isle. Barron has created not only a magical land populated
      by remarkable beings but also a completely magical tale, filled with ancient
      Celtic and Druidic lore, that will enchant readers.

      takes some intriguing twists. Young Emrys washes up on a Welsh beach with a
      woman who claims to be his mother. For years, they share a hovel, but Branwen
      tells him nothing about his past. One day he discovers that he has some unusual
      powers; using them to kindle a fire in Branwen''s defense, he is blinded by
      the flames. However, he learns to see without eyes?using his "second sight."
      Desperate to know about his past, Emrys, now 12, sets off on an ocean journey.
      He lands on Fincayra, where he plunges into a dangerous quest to rescue the
      island from the destructive blight caused by a pact between its king and an
      evil power. In the process, he befriends a young Fincayran girl and a dwarf
      who becomes a giant through a brave deed. Emrys also learns the truth about
      his origins. The Fincayran portion of the story is very much like Lloyd Alexander''s
      "Prydain Chronicles": a young boy and girl team up with a cute non-human to
      save a kingdom from the force of evil, with Welsh-style names abounding. Also,
      while the characterization of the hero is excellent, the portrayal of some minor
      figures is fair at best. However, the fast-moving plot is sure to keep readers
      turning pages. The tale is compelling enough to ensure that they will anticipate
      the next book in the series to learn how the events ultimately tie in to the
      more familiar body of Arthurian legend.'

      her equally disagreeable invalid cousin is as real and wise and enthralling
      now as it was when it was first written over 75 years ago. The strength of her
      characterizations pulls readers into the story, and the depth inherent in the
      seemingly simple plot continues to make this sometimes forgotten story as vital
      to the maturation of young readers as Tom Sawyer and Little Women. Hague's illustrations
      enhance the story beautifully, capturing as they do, both the old-fashioned
      and timeless quality of the tale. The charm, clarity, and muted tones of Hague's
      paintings add dimension to each part of the tale.

    - Ten-year-old Nick Allen has a reputation for devising clever, time-wasting schemes
      guaranteed to distract even the most conscientious teacher. His diversions backfire
      in Mrs. Granger's fifth-grade class, however, resulting in Nick being assigned
      an extra report on how new entries are added to the dictionary. Surprisingly,
      the research provides Nick with his best idea ever, and he decides to coin his
      own new word. Mrs. Granger has a passion for vocabulary, but Nick's (and soon
      the rest of the school's) insistence on referring to pens as "frindles" annoys
      her greatly. The war of words escalates--resulting in after-school punishments,
      a home visit from the principal, national publicity, economic opportunities
      for local entrepreneurs, and, eventually, inclusion of frindle in the dictionary.
      Slightly reminiscent of Avi's Nothing but the Truth (1991), this is a kinder,
      gentler story in which the two sides eventually come to a private meeting of
      the minds and the power of language triumphs over both. Sure to be popular with
      a wide range of readers, this will make a great read-aloud as well.

      how she will change her ways and treat others, especially her five younger brothers
      and sisters, with more respect and compassion. When Katy meets her Cousin Helen,
      an invalid, Katy is awed by her kindness, prettiness, and generosity. Katy is
      determined to become more like Helen, a resolution that lasts only a few hours.
      Soon, however, Katy gets a chance to become more like cousin Helen than she
      ever wished as she finds herself confined to her bedroom for four years as a
      result of an accident. Much of the story is focused on the change Katy undergoes
      during her illness. Helen visits again to advise Katy to learn from her experience
      and to try to become the center of the house by making her room and herself
      more attractive to others. One way Katy decides to take Helen's advice is through
      assuming the responsibility of running the house, a job that consists of giving
      the servants instructions and ringing her bell to summon her sisters when she
      has a task for them. As soon as Katy has learned the lesson about how to care
      for others, she recovers and regains the ability to walk.

      prose. The description of the party is characteristically spunky, as "Cy Clops
      bebopped and the Fang flip-flopped. The Boogeyman boogied while the trolls twirled
      round." Grimly's illustrations, which are similar to those in Marilyn Singer's

      drawn with ink and watercolor in subdued hues. Young readers will delight in
      the ghoulish details like the "Pizza Glut" box in Bella's house and the shrunken
      heads by the punch bowl at the shindig. This is a bewitching choice for libraries
      looking to boost their Halloween offerings.

      lad named Paddy rampages through the streets of Barrytown with a pack of like-minded
      hooligans, playing cowboys and Indians, etching their names in wet concrete,
      and setting fires. Roddy Doyle has captured the sensations and speech patterns
      of preadolescents with consummate skill, and managed to do so without resorting
      to sentimentality. Paddy Clarke and his friends are not bad boys; they're just
      a little bit restless. They're always taking sides, bullying each other, and
      secretly wishing they didn't have to. All they want is for something--anything--to
      happen.\r\n\r\nThroughout the novel, Paddy teeters on the nervous verge of adolescence.
      In one scene, Paddy tries to make his little brother's hot water bottle explode,
      but gives up after stomping on it just one time: \"I jumped on Sinbad's bottle.
      Nothing happened. I didn't do it again. Sometimes when nothing happened it was
      really getting ready to happen.\" Paddy Clarke senses that his world is about
      to change forever--and not necessarily for the better. When he realizes that
      his parents' marriage is falling apart, Paddy stays up all night listening,
      half-believing that his vigil will ward off further fighting. It doesn't work,
      but it is sweet and sad that he believes it might. Paddy's logic may be fuzzy,
      but his heart is in the right place. "

    - ! 'A young girl, Marjan, rescues the fabled Shahrazad from the Sultan''s wrath
      in this exciting and thought-provoking novel from Fletcher (Flight of the Dragon
      Kyn, 1993, etc.). With her crippled foot, Marjan never expects to be dragged
      off to the palace, but that is what happens after a chance meeting with Shahrazadthe
      storyteller who wins her life each night with cliffhanging stories for the sultan,
      and who obtains a story from Marjan. Heartbroken at leaving her Aunt Chava and
      her Uncle Eli, Marjan confronts cruelty within the palace''s lush interior,
      where wives and concubines can be executed at the sultan''s whim, and where
      the Khatun, the sultan''s mother, spies on everyone. Dispatched by Shahrazad
      to find more stories, Marjan sneaks out into the marketplace, where she eventually
      finds an old storyteller who tells her the end of a story of which the sultan
      has become fond. Beaten and imprisoned by the Khatun, Marjan escapes the palace,
      only to return and tell the sultan an allegory that enables him to realize his
      love for Shahrazad, and to spare her life. Despite the licenses Fletcher takes
      with the story of Shahrazad, the novel may entice readers into the pages of
      Richard Burton''s far richer work; they will appreciate the power of storytellingthat
      it may expand the soul of even the most hardened listener. '

    - Japanese American Kabuo Miyomoto is arrested in 1954 for the murder of a fellow
      fisherman, Carl Heine. Miyomoto's trial, which provides a focal point to the
      novel, stirs memories of past relationships and events in the minds and hearts
      of the San Piedro Islanders. Through these memories, Guterson illuminates the
      grief of loss, the sting of prejudice triggered by World War II, and the imperatives
      of conscience. With mesmerizing clarity he conveys the voices of Kabuo's wife,
      Hatsue, and Ishmael Chambers, Hatsue's first love who, having suffered the loss
      of her love and the ravages of war, ages into a cynical journalist now covering
      Kabuo's trial. The novel poetically evokes the beauty of the land while revealing
      the harshness of war, the nuances of our legal system, and the injustice done
      to those interned in U.S. relocation camps. Highly recommended for all fiction
      collections.

    - A 1954 murder trial in an island community off the coast of Washington state
      broadens into an exploration of war, race, and the mysteries of human motivation.
      The dead man, Carl Heine, his accused murderer, Kabuo Miyomoto, and the one-man
      staff of the local newspaper, Ishmael Chambers, were all scarred by their experiences
      in World War II but resumed normal-seeming lives upon their return to the fishing
      and strawberry-farming community of San Piedro in Puget Sound. While fishermen
      Heine and Miyomoto set about raising families, the newspaperman remains alone
      and apart, alienated by the loss of an arm and a childhood love, who married
      Miyomoto. Chambers comes upon information that could alter the verdict of the
      trial if presented or change his own life if suppressed, creating a private
      trial as momentous as the public one, with the outcome as much in doubt. Guterson's
      first novel is compellingly suspenseful on each of its several levels.

    - ! 'Old passions, prejudices, and grudges surface in a Washington State island
      town when a Japanese man stands trial for the murder of a fisherman in the 1950s.
      Guterson (The Country Ahead of Us, the Country Behind, 1989, etc.) has written
      a thoughtful, poetic first novel, a cleverly constructed courtroom drama with
      detailed, compelling characters. Many years earlier, Kabuo Miyamoto''s family
      had made all but the last payment on seven acres of land they were in the process
      of buying from the Heine family. Then the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, and
      Kabuo''s family was interned. Etta Heine, Carl''s mother, called off the deal.
      Kabuo served in the war, returned, and wanted his land back. After changing
      hands a few times, the land ended up with Carl Heine. When Carl, a fisherman,
      is found drowned in his own net, all the circumstantial evidence, with the land
      dispute as a possible motive, points to Kabuo as the murderer. Meanwhile, Hatsue
      Miyamoto, Kabuo''s wife, is the undying passion of Ishmael Chambers, the publisher
      and editor of the town newspaper. Ishmael, who returned from the war minus an
      arm, can''t shake his obsession for Hatsue any more than he can ignore the ghost
      pains in his nonexistent arm. As a thick snowstorm whirls outside the courtroom,
      the story is unburied. The same incidents are recounted a number of times, with
      each telling revealing new facts. In the end, justice and morality are proven
      to be intimately woven with beauty--the kind of awe and wonder that children
      feel for the world. But Guterson communicates these truths through detail, not
      philosophical argument: Readers will come away with a surprising store of knowledge
      regarding gill-netting boats and other specifics of life in the Pacific Northwest.
      Packed with lovely moments and as compact as haiku--at the same time, a page-turner
      full of twists.'

      would be a terrifying disaster. For the young Native American girl in Paul Goble's
      1979 Caldecott-winning masterpiece, The Girl Who Loved Wild Horses, it is a
      blessing. Although she loves her people, this girl has a much deeper, almost
      sacred connection to her equine friends. The storm gives her the opportunity
      to fulfill her dream--to live in a beautiful land among the wild horses she
      loves.\r\n\r\nWith brilliant, stylized illustrations and simple text, Paul Goble
      tells the story of a young woman who follows her heart, and the family that
      respects and accepts her uniqueness. Considering how difficult it is for some
      communities to allow friendships to grow between people of different cultures,
      this village's support for the girl's companions of choice is admirable. Goble's
      bold paintings reflect this noble open-mindedness. The young horse fanatic of
      the house will joyfully add this book to his or her collection. Children are
      passionate people; they will relate."

    - After stealing the hearts of middle-grade girls with her delightful Newbery
      Honor-winning Cinderella retelling, Ella Enchanted, Gail Carson Levine here
      creates a fairy tale of her own and gives it a characteristic grrrl-power twist.
      Twelve-year-old Addie admires her older sister Meryl, who aspires to rid the
      kingdom of Bamarre of gryphons, specters, and ogres. Addie, on the other hand,
      is fearful even of spiders and depends on Meryl for courage and protection.
      Waving her sword Bloodbiter, the older girl declaims in the garden from the
      heroic epic of Drualt to a thrilled audience of Addie, their governess, and
      the young sorcerer Rhys. But when Meryl falls ill with the dreaded Gray Death,
      Addie must gather her courage and set off alone on a quest to find the cure
      and save her beloved sister. Addie takes the seven-league boots and magic spyglass
      left to her by her mother and the enchanted tablecloth and cloak given to her
      by Rhys--along with a shy declaration of his love. She prevails in encounters
      with tricky specters (spiders too) and outwits a wickedly personable dragon
      in adventures touched with romance and a bittersweet ending. Young fans of princess
      stories will gobble this one up.

    - This story takes place in a magical time and mystical place and is teaming with
      dragons, specters, gryphons, elves, and fairies. Princesses Addie and Meryl
      live with their father, the king, in the castle of Bamarre, where magic and
      sorcery are a part of everyday life. While Meryl is fearless and confident,
      Addie is quite comfortable letting others take care of her. When Meryl falls
      victim to a mysterious illness called the Gray Death, which has already taken
      countless citizens including the girls' mother, Addie is determined to find
      the cure and save her. The prophecy is that "the Gray Death will be cured when
      cowards find courage and rain falls over all Bamarre." Aided by magical gifts
      from her governess, the elf nurse, and the king's sorcerer, Addie begins her
      quest. In a Chaucer-like tale, the story of Drualt, a hero of epic proportions,
      is excerpted in verse throughout the story. He serves as a role model for Addie,
      who believes she is weak, but her adventures teach her that one must look within
      to find strength. While this lesson is presented in a somewhat didactic manner,
      it is one that adolescents can never hear too often. An unexpected twist neatly
      ties up most of the loose ends. The characters aren't as fully drawn and the
      writing is not as consistent as we have come to expect from Levine, resulting
      in a slow starter that speeds up slightly at the end.

      When captured by Vollys, a she-dragon who knows the cure, Addie uses her skills,

      will find this an exciting adventure story with a sympathetic heroine. Both
      princesses are well-defined characters, and the portrayal of the dragon is quite

    - A story about an enormous pumpkin that gets out of hand. The Baxter boys make
      the mistake of cutting it from the vine before they have worked out how to get
      it safely home. With a repeated rhythmic chorus that kids will love to chime
      in on, the pumpkin makes its way through the hillside farm, scattering animals
      and Baxters in its wake. The family members finally manage to get it inside,
      and Granny cooks up a feast for Halloween supper. Schindler's gouache-and-pencil
      illustrations are amusing and rich in detail. Children will enjoy seeing the
      animals' reactions, as the out-of-control pumpkin wreaks havoc on sty and henhouse,
      and will also appreciate the family's inventive Halloween costumes. This is
      a fun read-aloud, without the dark overtones of so many of the holiday's stories,
      but it pays to practice the text once or twice as it can be a bit of a tongue-twister.
      At the end, readers are likely to be left with a longing for an appendix of

    - (Helen) Beatrix Potter (1866-1943) was an English author and illustrator, botanist,
      and conservationist, born in Kensington, London best known for her children's
      books, which featured animal characters such as Peter Rabbit. Educated at home
      by a succession of governesses, she had little opportunity to mix with other
      children. Potter had frogs and newts, and even a pet bat. The basis of her many
      projects and stories were the small animals that she smuggled into the house
      or observed during family holidays in Scotland and the Lake District. She was
      encouraged to publish her story, The Tale of Peter Rabbit (1902), but she struggled
      to find a publisher until it was accepted when she was 36, by Frederick Warne
      & Co. The small book and her following works were extremely well received and
      she gained an independent income from the sales. Potter eventually wrote 23
      books. These were published in a small format, easy for a child to hold and
      read. Her writing efforts abated around 1920 due to poor eyesight.

    - As an old peasant couple flee the devastation of their Korean village, which
      has been invaded by the Chinese and the North Koreans, they find a young boy
      dying in a ditch. The woman, who has lost her own child, is overcome by a ferocious
      need to save the child. The man's equally strong instinct is for self-preservation.
      The wife's will is stronger; the child joins them, and ultimately makes himself
      indispensable to their survival. The story recounts the wartime perils that
      the threesome encounter; the tension between the old man and the boy; their
      individual memories, fears, and dreams; and the eventual inevitable separation.
      The book contains subtle, unobtrusive symbolism for those who wish to puzzle
      over the meaning of the Christian hymn of the title, the nomadic nature of the
      journey, the namelessness of the peasants, the rescue of the boy by a Jewish
      chaplain, and the mysticism of the old villager. Most readers however, will
      experience the story as a simple and powerful narrative of survival of the human
      spirit.

    - ! 'At first glance, this acutely moving novel by the author of The Chosen and
      other stories of punishing spiritual journeys within Orthodox Judaism, may seem
      a departure. Here, the setting is Korea of the 1950''s as two aged peasants
      and an orphaned boy survive a cruel refugee trek. But the old pair and the boy,
      like all hapless innocents and victims of catastrophe, search within the shell
      of self for the answer to a universal pliant: ``Why do the spirits play with
      us?'''' Each will find some warmth in a spark of love. The 11-year-old boy,
      grandson of a famous poet and scholar, is dying in a ditch beside the old woman
      and her husband. The woman refuses to leave him and tends his wounds; the old
      man considers him ``a burden sent by evil spirits,'''' but cannot shake the
      resolve of the ``crazy'''' old woman. The journey from Seoul to the refugee
      camp and the camp itself mean near-fatal starvation, terrible cold, roads and
      fields of dead and dying. Yet the boy''s healing will occur with the change
      in the journeying as the pair becomes a trio. Because of the boy, the old man''s
      life is saved. Could he have a magic power? And within each are fevered dreams
      and memories. The woman, racked by fatigue, pleads with the spirits; the old
      man sees his uncle, the ``great hunter,'''' amid images of flying hawks; the
      boy is tortured by images of a beloved family, hands tied, sightless in a mass
      grave. Then--surely the boy is magic--the three find that the old man''s village
      has been spared. Now the dangers the boy must face are more subtle, yet deadlier
      than fierce weather, hardship, or a terrible foe. Potok has created a landscape
      of horror and beauty that seems charged with spirits--both malevolent and benign--and
      a human landscape where, against the terror of empty meaninglessness, only connection
      offers salvation.'

    - An important summer in the life of 12-year-old Patricia Potter involves a trip
      back in time for her to observe her mother, Ruth, in her mother's twelfth year.
      While her parents, both successful career people in Toronto, work out a separation,
      Patricia is sent off to her aunt's lake cottage in Alberta. Raised by fashionable
      and undemonstrative parents, Patricia feels out of place in the company of her
      rough-and-tumble cousins. Her escape comes when she discovers an old watch engraved
      to her grandmother, Patricia. When she winds up the watch she becomes an invisible
      observer to the happenings that took place in her mother's family 35 years ago.
      Patricia goes back and forth in time, observing her mother's unhappy childhood,
      and she decides to give her mother another chance, knowing what she does about
      the past. Although the novel is about two generations of mother-daughter relationships,
      all readers see of the grown-up mothers, Ruth and Nan, is from the perspective
      of a child. Hence, both appear as wooden and flat characters. Although the watch
      device is a handy one to allow the girl a glimpse of the past, there is not
      much explanation as to how or why the watch possesses this power. Science fiction
      fans may be disappointed, but the book will show adolescents how relationships
      in the present are often locked into patterns of the past, and that a discovery
      of one's family often reveals much about oneself.

    - With simple, rhyming statements and a few questions, 23 animals describe their
      efforts to make a birthday party for a young, gleeful, red-haired boy. The fun
      begins with a date circled on the calendar. "`Hey, what's the big deal?' noticed
      the seal. `Birthday today!' reported the ray." Interesting verbs add to the
      fun, as in "`We need some more forks!' flurried the storks"; and "`Go on, make
      a wish,' burbled the fish." While Rose's strong rhythm and rhymes will charm
      youngsters in a storytime, Munsinger's lively pen-and-ink and watercolor illustrations
      beg for closer inspection. Readers will delight in the skillfully drawn, realistic
      animals engaged in fantastic activity, such as the seal bearing a stack of gifts
      on the top of his nose, the sloth lying on the tablecloth he is spreading, bats
      sporting paper hats, and much more on each captivating spread. A sense of reality
      wordlessly returns on the concluding page as the boy feeds cake to his menagerie
      of stuffed animals. Libraries will want to support birthdays, zoo trips, and
      flights of fancy with this splendid celebration.

    - ! 'If you''ve grown up at a time when orbiting satellites were taken for granted,
      you''d probably not find reading a book about longitude an enticing prospect.
      But Sobel, an award-winning former science reporter for the New York Times who
      writes frequently for Audubon, Discover, LIFE, and Omni magazines, has transformed
      what could have been a dry subject into an interesting tale of scientific discovery.
      It is difficult to realize that a problem that can now be solved with a couple
      of cheap watches and a few simple calculations at one time appeared insurmountable.
      In 1714, the British Parliament offered a king''s ransom of #20 million ($12
      million in today''s currency) to anyone who could solve the problem of how to
      measure longitude at sea. Sobel recounts clockmaker John Harrison''s lifelong
      struggle to win this prize by developing a timepiece impervious to the pitch
      and roll of the sea. His clock, known today as the chronometer, was rejected
      by the Longitude Board, which favored a celestial solution. Despite some awkward
      writing, this brief, if at times sketchy, book is recommended for popular science
      collections.'

    - In the 1700s navigators could easily compute latitude, but finding longitude
      was nigh impossible. So valuable was a solution in terms of saving ships from
      fetching on rocks that England offered a munificent prize for a practicable
      method, and soon two avenues offered themselves. An accurate chronometer occupied
      the thoughts of clockmaker John Harrison, and a tediously compiled catalog of
      the stars, against which the moon could be used as a "clock," was pursued by
      astronomers. Sobel presents the contest's course with a stylish mix of technical
      and human insight that emphasizes Harrison's life and dealings with the stingy
      Board of Longitude, custodian of the prize. When his contraption, the fruit
      of decades of solitary labor, went to sea and seemingly met the requirements,
      the Board balked, not least because one of its members was the very astronomer
      working on the celestial method. His glory dimmed by raw rivalry, Harrison fell
      into obscurity, and his chronometers into disrepair until restored 60 years
      ago. Completing the rehabilitation, Sobel's is an exquisitely told tale of perseverance,
      disappointment, and vindication.

      account of near-death in the Peruvian Andes, is a compact tour de force that
      wrestles with issues of bravery, friendship, physical endurance, the code of
      the mountains, and the will to live. Simpson dedicates the book to his climbing
      partner, Simon Yates, and to "those friends who have gone to the mountains and
      have not returned." What is it that compels certain individuals to willingly
      seek out the most inhospitable climate on earth? To risk their lives in an attempt
      to leave footprints where few or none have gone before? Simpson''s vivid narrative
      of a dangerous climbing expedition will convince even the most die-hard couch
      potato that such pursuits fall within the realm of the sane. As the author struggles
      ever higher, readers learn of the mountain''s awesome power, the beautiful--and
      sometimes deadly--sheets of blue glacial ice, and the accomplishment of a successful
      ascent. And then catastrophe: the second half of Touching the Void sees Simpson
      at his darkest moment. With a smashed, useless leg, he and his partner must
      struggle down a near-vertical face--and that''s only the beginning of their

    - Somewhere in this book, Wharton observes that clever liars always come up with
      good stories to back up their fabrications, but that really clever liars don't
      bother to explain anything at all. This is the kind of insight that makes The
      Age of Innocence so indispensable. Wharton's story of the upper classes of Old
      New York, and Newland Archer's impossible love for the disgraced Countess Olenska,
      is a perfectly wrought book about an era when upper-class culture in this country
      was still a mixture of American and European extracts, and when "society" had
      rules as rigid as any in history.

      literature to make it more accessible to contemporary readers. The major events
      of Gulliver''s travels are recounted here, but the language has been simplified
      and updated. The lengthier descriptive passages have been eliminated, as have
      some of the complex political discussions. The adaptation is not as dark as
      the original; for example, in this conclusion, Gulliver is not completely repulsed
      by his wife and family. Despite these changes, this retelling retains the essence
      of the original work, primarily due to the careful choice of details and scenes
      portrayed. The streamlined story remains a lively adventure filled with bizarre
      and entertaining characters. Swift''s satirical humor and irony are still evident,
      as are his political and humanitarian messages. Ridell''s energetic illustrations
      provide the perfect complement to the multidimensional story; black-and-white
      drawings and colorful line-and-wash paintings enliven almost every spread. Humorous
      details, vivid facial expressions, and exaggerated perspectives and proportions
      visually project the tale''s sense of adventure. '

      13 stories, almost all of them well known, honors the Danish storyteller in
      form as well as content. Stewart's muted artwork (a mix of large, full-color
      images and smaller, often sepia-toned decorations) elegantly reflects the qualities
      of beauty, tragedy, and farce found in the stories. At the same time, many of
      the images, such as the grotesque witch in the "Tinderbox," whose "lower lip
      hung down to her waist," suggest a taste for whimsy that Andersen surely would
      have applauded. Theatrical motifs can be glimpsed throughout, nodding to the
      writer's passion for staging miniature performances. Andersen scholar and translator
      Lewis has published versions of many of these same stories elsewhere, and her
      foreword and story introductions accessibly highlight Andersen's genius.

      collections and picture books over the past 20 years. Thirteen of them appear
      in this lavishly illustrated volume. In new introductions to each story, Lewis
      provides background and context, connecting the tale to Andersen's life and
      offering her own interpretation of its theme. Stewart's digitally created drawings
      shed fresh light on the stories as well. Each page facing a story's introduction
      presents a color picture showing a stage, framed with red curtains and footlights,
      on which the central character acts out an important scene. Many stories receive
      an additional full-page illustration, and all are decorated with small rectangular
      sepia illustrations, while other drawings float freely across a page. Balancing
      astringent wit while plumbing emotional depths, Stewart's artwork is an appropriate
      partner to Andersen's words.

    - Review from Children's Literature
    - ! 'Here the Christmas story that we all love is presented in its original language
      with artwork that captures the period and its ghostly theme. The beautiful language
      is once again a joy to read. ... Unusual words of the period such as, negus,
      Cold Boiled, or bedight, may be looked up or understood in the context. The
      watercolor and gauche illustrations with smoky spirits and pages tinted with
      wash draw us into the surreal spirit world. The snowy village with hovering
      ghosts on the book jacket and the greenish moire book cover with the door knocker
      of Marley''s head, immediately set the tone. This is a jewel of a book for Christmas
      giving and family enjoyment. '

    - Book Description
    - To be a real boy — that is the heart's desire of the little wooden puppet carved
      by the old and sprightly Geppeto. Naughty, mischevious, and bold, Pinocchio
      sets off on adventures and gets into trouble — but to achieve his desire, he
      will have to face many challenges and learn some very important lessons. Emma
      Rose's superb new translation is matched by Fanelli's playful illustrations
      in this unique edition of Carlo Collodi's 1883 classic.

    - From the Illustrator, Sara Fanelli
    - ! "Pinocchio was a part of my childhood: I was born and grew up in Florence,
      the birthplace of Carlo Collodi, and the puppet was present not just in the
      words of the book, but also quite literally in the everyday landscape, in the
      shop windows and markets. Children often sang songs and rhymes about him and
      sometimes I even used to put on a pointy hat and pretend I was a little puppet
      to my family.\r\n\r\nWhen I first read Pinocchio as a child, I reacted against
      its moralistic undertones; when I read it as a grown-up illustrator I fell for
      the energy and surrealism of the puppet's escapades. There is a wonderful tradition
      of Italian artists giving the story a life in pictures, I tried to create a
      world that would be playful and attractive to a contemporary child yet which
      was also truthful to the original setting of the story in rural Tuscany.\r\n\r\nThe
      long-awaited finale, when Pinocchio changes from being a puppet to a real boy,
      has always had a bittersweet tone for me - but I hope that there is enough fantasy
      and colour in these pages to make the story last beyond the puppet's lifespan,
      to overflow into a real child's world. "

    - Book Description
    - First published in 1884 in THE JUNGLE BOOK, these three stories tell of Mowgli's
      upbringing by wolves in the Indian jungle. When he is a baby they save him from
      the tiger Shere Khan, then teach him the law and language of the jungle animals,
      with help from two other unforgettable characters, Baloo the bear and Bagheera
      the panther. In this classic edition, Mowgli's adventures are illustrated in
      ravishing and exquisite detail by Nicola Bayley.

    - Note from the Illustrator
    - ! "For me, illustrating a classic is treading a fine line between authenticity
      and beauty. I'd been to India and visited all sorts of places you wouldn't normally
      see and I went to libraries in London to find out what the country was like
      in Kipling's time. But then I added things of my own, like the borders, which
      enrich the book and try to capture the spicy, earthy colours I remembered. For
      Mowgli, I looked at the hundreds of photos I have of my son to understand how
      a body moves. That made it very personal. \r\n\r\nI worked in crayon –­ I must
      have used well over a hundred coloured pencils – in my basement studio where
      all I can see out of the window is greenery. I shared my table with my two cats
      who fought for a warm place under the light. I love cats – maybe that's why
      I enjoyed drawing Shere Khan the most. I thought Bagheera the panther would
      be the biggest challenge: he has black spots on black fur and that's difficult
      to get right, but in the end he was easier than the wolves with their angular,
      straight lines. It was a wonderful book to illustrate."

    - ! "Suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\r\n\r\nThere was
      nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out
      of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \"Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be
      too late!\"\r\n\r\nLewis Carroll's masterpiece, an exuberant mix of fun and
      fantasy, logic and lunacy, silliness and droll splendor, revolutionized children's
      literature. Its influence has been immeasurable, and the story's cast of characters,
      including Alice herself, the Mad Hatter, and the Cheshire Cat, hold a beloved

    - The illustrator, Helen Oxenbury, writes
    - ! "I was introduced to 'Alice in Wonderland' by my mother who had loved it as
      a child. She read it to me when I was about eight and many of Carroll's jokes
      and much of his wonderful nonsense went over my head, but she must have passed
      on her enthusiasm, because I have read it many times since then and my enjoyment
      grows with each reading. \r\n\r\nI admire Tenniel's original illustrations enormously,
      but I find his typically Victorian style rather stiff. Though 'Alice in Wonderland'
      has been illustrated by many different artists since, my rationale for attempting
      another version was to make Alice a child of our time and to include many more
      illustrations of the wonderful and eccentric peripheral characters that people
      Carroll's masterpiece."

    - ! "Anyone who has ever read 'The Wind in the Willows' knows how delightful it
      is to get lost, even for an hour or two, in the world within its pages. \r\n\r\nIllustrating
      the book, of course, takes a lot longer. In my case it took over two years,
      two wonderful years spent in the company of Ratty, Mole, Mr Badger and The Toad.
      As I worked I found myself thinking more and more about their creator, Kenneth
      Grahame. Perhaps this is inevitable when you go deeply into a work, but I like
      to think it was also because I share his love of the English countryside. Searching
      there for inspiration for my illustrations, it was as if I had – even if it
      was just for a while – come upon a common spring."

    - A tragic tale of obsession and revenge set against the unforgiving sea, Herman
      Melville's Moby-Dick has now been expertly edited and generously illustrated
      for the twenty-first-century reader. Here are the mad whaling captain Ahab,
      the all-observant narrator Ishmael, and the mysterious, invincible white whale
      himself, and here are scenes of peril and carnage, nobility and redemption —
      presented in Melville's original language, threaded together with passages of
      summary by renowned author Jan Needle. Lavish artwork by Patrick Benson, one
      of the finest children's illustrators working today, captures the timeless spirit
      of this extraordinary classic.

    - From School Library Journal
    - Grade 5–9—In this beautifully designed adaptation of the classic novel, Needle
      sticks largely to Melville's original wording, but leaves out lengthy passages
      on whaling and the day-to-day workings of a seafaring voyage. New passages are
      delineated with an italicized font, and the tale flows fairly seamlessly between
      the original text and Needle's interspersed summaries and commentary. Although
      this is technically an abridgement, the length and complexity of Melville's
      text plus Needle's commentary direct it to an intermediate audience. Handsome
      pencil, ink, and watercolor illustrations on nearly every spread evoke the vastness
      and unfathomable mystery of the sea, varying from black and white to full color.
      A glossary and cross-section of a whaling ship assist in understanding the tale.
      This version of the story is for readers who want to read Moby-Dick, with its
      intriguing characters and thrilling adventure, but are perhaps not ready for
      the full-length tale.

    - From Booklist
    - Considerably abridged from what Needle characterizes as Herman Melville's "enormous
      . . . long and rambling, even obscure" novel, this reworking, with moody illustrations
      on nearly every page, won't look out of place on a coffee table but still offers
      plenty of substance. Needle links passages of the original book, ranging in
      length from one line to several pages, with extended, ruminative summaries and
      his own comments, which are distinguished by a lighter typeface. Benson ably
      captures the tale's gloom and grandeur with a plethora of strong character portraits
      and other illustrations, mostly rendered in shadowed, atmospheric pen and ink,
      that burst into full color when the white whale arrives on the scene.

      he is offered food and shelter by Raghunath, the warm and caring host. He goes
      away the next day, but not before leaving a pouch whose valuable contents will
      test the limits of Raghunath’s honesty.\r\n\r\nWhile the charcoal sketches bring
      to life the humble life and household of Raghunath, the story, originally written
      in Bengali by Bimal Kar and translated into English by Enakshi Chatterjee, is
      about the decline in human values as one falls a prey to greed. As the prologue
      to the book describes, it is a story “exploring truth, falsehood and everything
      in between.”"

      reflect a modern mind and have inspired many young writers whom he also supported
      at the start of their literary careers.\r\n\r\nFor children, Kar created the
      retired magician Kinkar Kishore Ray, alias Kikira who solved mysteries with
      his two assistants. Kar also has to his credit several novels that were successfully

    - From an interview with the author
    - ! "People liked “The Myna from Peacock Garden.” Sometimes adults wrote to me
      saying that they’d read this story of mine and it made them weep for hours.
      ... it did make adults weep, but I don’t think it had the same effect on children
      who read it!... I I wanted to deal with ...Lucknow, and the culture of Lucknow
      in a story, and then go from Lucknow to Avadh, from Avadh to Muslims, and Hindus....
      A way of treating these topics [and this period] has developed in India which\r\ngives
      people the impression that the characters in question were always backwards
      and decadent, and if they hadn’t been, why did the government end up in British
      hands? Our children had no idea that there were positive aspects about life
      in those times as well, and thought instead that the people of those times were
      completely ignorant and undeveloped. I thought I would write an interesting
      story so that children could get a bit of a notion about what the earlier traditions
      were, and gain a kind of empathy with their own past by reading it."

      Ramona Quimby tries hard to do her part to keep family peace. Usually, however,
      she ends up behind every uproarious incident in the house. Whether she's dying
      herself blue, watching while her young neighbor flings Kleenex around the house,
      or wearing her soft new pajamas to school one day (under her clothes, of course),
      Ramona's life is never dull. Through it all, she is struggling for a place in
      her mother's heart, worried that she might be unlovable. Not a chance. Ramona
      Quimby is nothing if not lovable.\r\n\r\nBeverly Cleary's gift for understanding
      the tangle of thoughts and emotions in a child's mind and heart is remarkable.
      Luckily, in addition to being empathic, witty, and astute, Cleary is also prolific.

      docks. One afternoon a sailor asked him to pipe a tune, and that evening Jessie
      was kidnapped and dumped aboard The Moonlight, a slave ship, where a hateful
      duty awaited him. He was to play music so the slaves could "dance" to keep their
      muscles strong, their bodies profitable. Jessie was sickened by the thought
      of taking part in the business of trading rum and tobacco for blacks and then
      selling the ones who survived the frightful sea voyage from Africa. But to the
      men of the ship a "slave dancer" was necessary to ensure their share of the
      profit. They did not heed the horrors that every day grew more vivid, more inescapable
      to Jessie. Yet , even after four months of fear, calculated torture, and hazardous
      sailing with a degraded crew, Jessie was to face a final horror that would stay
      with him for the rest of his life.

    - ! "\"The question I am most often asked,\" Jean Fritz says, \"is how do I find
      my ideas? The answer is: I don't. Ideas find me. A character in history will
      suddenly step right out of the past and demand a book. Generally people don't
      bother to speak to me unless there's a good chance that I'll take them on.\"
      Throughout almost four decades of writing about history, Jean Fritz has taken
      on plenty of people, starting with George Washington in The Cabin Faced West
      (1958). Since then, her refreshingly informal historical biographies for children
      have been widely acclaimed as \"unconventional,\" \"good-humored,\" \"witty,\"
      \"irrepressible,\" and \"extraordinary.\"\r\n\r\nIn her role as biographer,
      Jean Fritz attempts to uncover the adventures and personalities behind each
      character she researches. \"Once my character and I have reached an understanding,\"
      she explains, \"then I begin the detective work--reading old books, old letters,
      old newspapers, and visiting the places where my subject lived. Often I turn
      up surprises and of course I pass these on.\" It is her penchant for making
      distant historical figures seem real that brings the characters to life and
      makes the biographies entertaining, informative, and filled with natural child
      appeal.\r\n\r\nAn original and lively thinker, as well as an inspiration to
      children and adults, Jean Fritz is undeniably a master of her craft. She was
      awarded the Regina Medal by the Catholic Library Association, presented with

      among us will adore this artfully spun classic. The Borrowers--a Carnegie Medal
      winner, a Lewis Carroll Shelf Award book, and an ALA Distinguished Book--has
      stolen the hearts of thousands of readers since its 1953 publication. Mary Norton
      (1903-1993) creates a make-believe world in which tiny people live hidden from
      humankind beneath the floorboards of a quiet country house in England.\r\n\r\nPod,
      Homily, and daughter Arrietty of the diminutive Clock family outfit their subterranean
      quarters with the tidbits and trinkets they've \"borrowed\" from \"human beans,\"
      employing matchboxes for storage and postage stamps for paintings. Readers will
      delight in the resourceful way the Borrowers recycle household objects. For
      example, \"Homily had made her a small pair of Turkish bloomers from two glove
      fingers for 'knocking about in the mornings.'\"\r\n\r\nThe persistent pilfering
      goes undetected until a boy (with a ferret!) comes to live in the country house.
      Curiosity drives Arrietty to commit the worst mistake a Borrower can make: she
      allows herself to be seen. This engaging, sometimes hair-raisingly suspenseful
      adventure is recounted in the kind, eloquent voice of narrator Mrs. May, whose
      brother might--just might--have seen an actual Borrower in the country house
      many years ago."

    - On the Nasel River, Washington state, in 1899, 12-year-old May Amelia Jackson
      feels overwhelmed with her seemingly unlimited supply of brothers and manages
      to get herself in trouble with animal traps, bears, floods, and more. Everyone,
      especially her stern father, asks her why she is such a no-account girl and
      admonishes her to act like a Proper Young Lady. Her fondest wish comes true
      with the birth of a little sister who is put in her care while her mother recuperates.
      When the baby dies, May Amelias vituperative Finnish grandmother publicly blames
      her at the funeral. The girl gives in to grief and rage, swearing that she will
      never again live with her family. A stay with a kindly aunt and uncle in a bustling
      city provides more adventure, a bit of polish, and a best girl friend. But when
      news arrives that Grandmother Patience has passed away, May Amelia must make
      an important decision. Her first-person narrative, in an almost stream-of-consciousness
      style, has plenty of hilarity to lighten the pathos inevitably found in the
      harsh reality of pioneer life. Holm also pays much attention to the limited
      roles allowed women of this era, describing Indian healers, tavern keepers,
      teachers, and even an aunt who is supported by an affluent gentleman. An engaging
      family story, portions of which will make dramatic read-alouds.

      and seven brothers in the state of Washington in the late 1800s. She records
      the details of her life in a diary using the present tense and a folksy speech
      pattern: "I go about fixing dinner real quiet-like so they can talk and tell
      secrets." Aside from quarrels with her adoptive brother Kaarlo, May lives a
      relatively bucolic life until the arrival of her shrewish grandmother, who finds
      fault with everything May says and does. The author bases her story on her aunt''s
      real diary, so the everyday details of life among Finnish immigrants add a nice
      specificity to the background, and May is appealingly vivacious. However, the
      lack of quotation marks, the overuse of certain expressions (among them, "indeed"),
      the length, and sometimes slow pacing may make this a secondary purchase.'

      lions are curled up with turkeys. Finally the gentle rocking of the ark lulls

      is a self-satisfied girl used to doing exactly as she pleases. So when signs
      around the entrance to the shortcut read "DANGER," "TURN BACK," "VERY RISKY"
      and even "GO THE OTHER WAY," the undaunted lass tromps headlong into adventure.
      Once inside the house of the three bears, Goldilocks notices a lot of coarse
      brown fur and thinks, "They must have kitties." She thrashes her way through
      the bears'' domain. Eventually, they return and scare the girl off, but whether
      or not she has learned her lesson is left to the imagination. Marshall''s wonderfully

      the cows'' request, the bovine organizers go on strike. Through the use of the
      man''s shadow, Lewin communicates his rage: the straw in his hat creates the
      appearance of his hair on end. With help from a neutral duck mediator, the exasperated
      Farmer Brown finally makes concessions. But, much to his dismay, the cows are
      not the only creatures that can type. Cronin humorously turns the tables on
      conventional barnyard dynamics; Lewin''s bold, loose-lined watercolors set a
      light and easygoing mood that matches Farmer Brown''s very funny predicament.
      Kids and underdogs everywhere will cheer for the clever critters that calmly
      and politely stand up for their rights, while their human caretaker becomes
      more and more unglued.'

    - ! '"Harry was a white dog with black spots who liked everything, except getting
      a bath." Taking matters into his own paws, he buries his family''s scrubbing
      brush in the backyard and runs away from home before they can wrangle him into
      the tub. Harry gets dirty playing in the street, dirtier at the railroad, and
      dirtier still playing tag with the other dogs. When sliding down the coal chute,
      he actually changes from a white dog with black spots to a black dog with white
      spots! Of course, by the time he gets home he is completely unrecognizable to
      his family--even when he does all his clever flip-flopping tricks. In a stroke
      of doggy genius, he unearths the bath brush, begs for a bath, and the rest is
      history. Youngsters will completely relate to the urge to rebel, the thrill
      of getting dirty, and, finally, the reassurance of family. Gene Zion and Margaret
      Bloy Graham''s Harry the Dirty Dog, first published in 1956 and now rereleased
      with splashes of color added by the artist herself, is one of those picture
      books that children never forget. '

      the most logical silliness to be found anywhere--at least since Laura Joffe
      Numeroff and illustrator Felicia Bond''s If You Give a Mouse a Cookie. Readers
      will follow a young boy and his voracious visitor through a series of antlered
      antics: jam reveries and puppet shows and big messes. It all makes perfect sense,
      really, once you stop to think about it. What moose wouldn''t want to borrow
      a sweater when it''s cold outside? And why shouldn''t the loose button on the
      sweater remind him of his grandmother? Bond''s cleverly detailed, witty illustrations
      perfectly complement Numeroff''s deadpan style. Through just a few deft words
      and brush strokes, the reader gets a real sense of the unique personalities
      of the two characters. Children will relate easily to the full-circle reasoning
      of the story, while picking up the concept of cause and effect. The moral of
      the story? Keep plenty of muffin mix and blackberry jam in your cupboard. You
      never know who may drop by. (Great read aloud, ages 4 to 8)'

    - In this when-in-Rome story, a stray dog alters his canine ways to appease half-a-dozen
      grouchy cats. Widget, a scruffy Westie, wanders into a farmhouse where he finds
      "six cats, six warm beds, and six bowls of hot food." The well-fed cats glare
      at him. "I wish you could stay," says the grandmotherly caretaker, Mrs. Diggs.
      "But I'm afraid the girls just can't stand dogs." Widget utters a hopeful "Meow?"
      Thereafter, he adopts feline ways, until the inevitable emergency ("Mrs. Diggs...
      fell down. She didn't move") compels him to bark and save the day. The McFarlands,
      who imagined a teddy bear mimicking a bird in The Pirate's Parrot, once again
      depict an adaptable outsider. Widget's name aptly suggests an unspecific, versatile
      object. In Jim McFarland's pen-and-ink and watercolor wash illustrations, the
      ingratiating dog appears the same size as his adoptive sisters, with pointed
      ears and a scruffy, upraised tail; he even casts a cat-shaped shadow. This story
      line offers no surprises, but it gives a fond account of cross-species conciliation,
      and, at their best, the pictures of the hero attempting to adapt to his housemates'
      behavior hint at the sly wit of James Stevenson's artwork. Ages 3-6.

    - Widget is a stray dog-homeless, cold, wet, and hungry. He finds his way to a
      warm, cozy home but then has to exercise all his ingenuity to convince the six
      female felines in residence to accept him. With a light and humorous touch,
      text and illustrations charm readers as Widget charms the cats by pretending
      to be one of them. The funniest spreads are of Widget and "the girls" facing
      off all puffed up, then hissing and spitting. The pup quickly realizes that
      purring, playing, and even using the litter box is the ticket into this household.
      In the end, the cats accept him on his own terms-as a dog-since it is barking,
      not meowing, that saves the day after a mishap suffered by their human guardian,
      Mrs. Diggs. Illustrations, apparently watercolors, are detailed and realistic
      with cartoon touches that add to the humor, as when six pairs of cats' eyes
      are all turned toward Widget, whose own wide eyes are trained in turn on them.
      This is a preschool crowd pleaser, just right for storytime.

    - Grade 1-3-Bright, whimsical illustrations and clever rhymes introduce challenging
      exercises. The verses are not particularly memorable, but they present the problems-how
      squares on a kite can be added quickly or peas in a pod grouped-with hints for
      their solutions. "My kite flies high, my kite flies free,/My kite just landed
      in a tree!/I was busy counting squares,/Now my kite is stuck up there./How many
      squares? Let me see,/It's best to add diagonally!" Teaching guides appear at
      the back of the book, and not all of the strategies for problem solving are
      obvious. In a note, Tang states that his goal is "to encourage clever, creative
      thinking," and the questions posed do that. This book will engage readers' visual
      and auditory senses and may be enjoyed one-on-one or in classroom settings.

      offers children another playful experience with arithmetic. It seems misleading
      to call the rhymes "riddles," as that implies some twist of humor in the answer.
      However, the colorful, digital artwork, which stretches across each double-page
      spread, creates a cheerful setting for the challenges. On the left-hand page,
      groups of objects are aligned in a way that will make counting them easier.
      On the right, a rhyme sets out the problem to be solved and hints at a path
      toward its solution. One example involves grouping pods of five or six peas
      into sets of eleven peas: "A pea would find it rather odd, / To be alone inside
      a pod . . . Can you count up all the peas? / With 11''s [sic] it''s a breeze!"
      Some children will find it quicker to devise their own strategies or just to
      count the objects than to figure out the hint and apply it to the solution,
      but those who persevere will learn a useful approach: grouping objects as an
      aid to counting them.'

      a prequel to the series that began in 1976 with the Caldecott Honor book Strega
      Nona. Here the author/artist tells how his charismatic character came to become
      a strega (witch) with a "magic touch." The "biography" begins on a dark and
      stormy night in the hills of Calabria, where Grandma Concetta authoritatively
      oversees Nona''s birth. Convinced that Nona will be a strega like her, the big-hearted
      woman teaches her granddaughter how to use herbs and spells to remedy villagers''
      aches and troubles. Nona, along with her overconfident friend Amelia (who sets
      herself up as Nona''s rival in some of the other books), attends the Academy
      for Stregas, but soon concludes that its newfangled approach to magic is not
      for her, and returns home to practice her craft the old-fashioned way. Eventually
      she discovers Grandma Concetta''s all-important secret ingredient: love. With
      their expressive faces and pertly exaggerated profiles (Strega Nona''s signature
      hooked nose punctuates her face even as a newborn), the classic characters happily
      cavort in sunnily colored, droll illustrations. And dePaola does a splendid
      job of working this sparkling tale into the Strega Nona canon: on the final
      page, for example, the aging strega opens her door to the first respondent to
      her ad for a helper, whom fans will immediately recognize as the gangly and
      beloved Big Anthony.'

    - Subtitled A Tale of a Peddler, Some Monkeys and Their Monkey Business, this
      absurd and very simple story has become a classic, selling hundreds of thousands
      of copies since its first publication in 1940. A peddler walks around selling
      caps from a tall, tottering pile on his head. Unable to sell a single cap one
      morning, he walks out into the countryside, sits down under a tree, checks that
      all the caps are in place, and falls asleep. When he wakes up, the caps are
      gone--and the tree is full of cap-wearing monkeys. His attempts to get the caps
      back generate the kind of repetitive rhythm that 3- and 4-year-olds will adore.

    - Have you ever gone on a bear hunt? Come along on this one with a brave young
      family - four children (including the baby) and their father. They're not scared.
      With them you will cross a field of tall, wavy grass ("Swishy swashy!"), wade
      through a deep, cold river ("Splash splosh!"), struggle through swampy mud ("Squelch
      squerch!"), find your way through a big, dark forest, ("Stumble trip!"), fight
      through a whirling snowstorm ("Hooo wooo!"), and enter a narrow, gloomy cave.
      WHAT'S THAT? You'll soon learn just what to do to escape from abig, furry bear!
      With tremendous pace, humor, and verve, Michael Rosen has retold a favorite
      traditional story. The pictures by Helen Oxenbury, one of the most widely loved
      contemporary artists, are full of masterly characterizations, delightful comedy,
      and high drama, set in lovely sweeping landscapes. This is a book not to be
      missed, one to be chanted aloud and acted out, to be enjoyed over and over again.
      Its a picture book on the grand scale.

      a snowmouse''s broom. They visit their friend monthly, seeing buds, then flowers,
      leaves, and finally fruit. In October, they mourn her loss of leaves. `` `Don''t
      worry,'' '''' explains Woody. `` `Next year I''ll have new ones. You''ll see!''
      '''' Only November''s activities seem forced; the mice worry about a Christmas
      gift for the tree. In December, they decorate her boughs with festive colored
      balls and bring gifts of fertilizer and flower seeds. Illustrations are typical
      Lionni, with simplified collage figures of torn and cut papers, some plain and
      some patterned, placed against a background that changes color with the season.
      Although the tree remains rooted, the mice scurry about, climbing it to pick
      fruit, aiming a hose when it catches fire, and jumping to catch falling leaves.
      The lack of irrelevant background details makes the tree''s changes clear and
      impressive. An enjoyable book that will help children become aware of the natural
      world around them. '

    - ! 'An accessible picture book about the life and work of Diego Rivera sounds
      like an oxymoron, but Winter and Winter succeed beyond belief. His early life
      is the focus; the text in Spanish and English captions the paintings. It does
      a journeyman''s job of conveying facts in well-condensed sentences; the Spanish
      translation is clear and easy to follow even for those readers without fluency
      in the language. Each picture is bordered with Mexican folk-art designs done
      in vivid, resonant, tropical tones. The paintings themselves are done in Rivera''s
      own colossal style, even though they actually measure only a few inches square.
      Winter displays her clear knowledge of and love for her subject. Frida Kahlo
      appears in one scene without any identification other than her distinctive eyebrows;
      this subtle allusion is the only mention of Rivera''s tempestuous personal life.
      The last pictures show him as a young man, perched on his scaffolding, brushes
      in hand, beckoning viewers on with his ardent glance. Readers will wish they
      could follow. '

    - Baba, Nicki's grandmother, knits pure white mittens for him, even though she
      is afraid that he will lose them in the snow. Sure enough, the first time Nicki
      is out, he drops one and some animals promptly move into its snug wool interior.
      First comes a mole, then a rabbit, a hedgehog, an owl, a badger, a fox, a bear
      and, finally, a mouse. That mouse tickles the bear's nose and he sneezes, dislodging
      all of the animals at once. Nicki finds his mitten, and takes it home, but Baba
      is left to wonder about how it became so enormously stretched out. Brett's magnificent
      paintings feature her usual array of folk details, and this time, intricate
      knitting tracks, ornate embroidery, the crusty, peeling texture of the birch
      bark borders and the exquisite patterns found in Baba's homey rooms. Readers
      will sit back, suspend belief and welcome this tall tale from the Ukrainian
      tradition. Ages 4-8.

    - Kindergarten-Grade 6-- Nouns of all kinds are the subject of Heller's latest
      in her series of books on parts of speech. Common, proper, abstract, concrete,
      compound, and collective nouns are all defined and shown by example in usually
      lilting verse. Singular, plural, and possessive forms of nouns are also thoroughly
      covered, and determiners are explained and demonstrated. The rhyme form is used
      with amazing skill but now and then seems forced as in, "Nouns are highly effective./
      The last kind of NOUN is . . . COLLECTIVE." How and why they work are not explained.
      Striking graphic design with large clear objects in bold colors overflowing
      each double-page spread make the book a visual treat. The use of bold type for
      all the nouns is particularly pleasing and will make for easy reading aloud.
      Heller's language books challenge users' creativity since the concepts are difficult
      for the picture-book format. Conversely, the verse and illustrations can delight
      very young children while older readers are sure to find the concise definitions
      clearer and certainly more entertaining than any grammar text. Those who have
      found the others in the series successful will want this one.

    - A starving dog is the catalyst that propels Tate, 10, toward adulthood. Plot
      and characterization effortlessly evolve through her narration, which is as
      honest and direct as the character herself. Her simple language is filled with
      images of rural New England. She describes her struggle to keep the stray, which
      begins as soon as the exhausted animal appears on her porch. Even though her
      mother is terrified of dogs, Tate quickly wraps her life around her new-found
      pet, whose ears are as soft as sable. However, the canine's wandering ways and
      stealing bring complaints from neighbors. Mam demands that Sable leave, and
      Pap finds her a good home with Doc Winston, whose land is surrounded by a high
      stone fence. Desolate but determined to win Sable back, Tate designs, buys the
      materials for, and builds her own fence. Weeks later, she visits Doc Winston
      and learns that the animal has disappeared. With the loss of Sable, Tate's focus
      shifts to helping her family; in turn, her father accepts her as an apprentice
      in his woodworking shop. An exceptional dog story-with a happy ending- whose
      length and pencil illustrations, one per chapter, make it attractive to young
      readers.

      and plunge full-steam ahead into the water, Ruby, the smallest, prefers to swim
      slowly, looking at everything around her. She quite often falls behind, but
      her encouraging siblings call, "This way, Ruby!" One day, while they race along,
      she notices something her siblings have not-a storm coming their way-and they
      have no idea which way to turn. Luckily, Ruby's observational skills come to
      the rescue. This is a sweet book for preschoolers, who will enjoy the little
      bit of danger and the reassurance that Ruby will find the way home. Harry's
      illustrations are charming, giving each duckling its own personality. The pastel
      palette provides a sense of comfort and well-being throughout. Small details
      are tucked into each picture for children to discover. This follow-up to Ruby
      in Her Own Time (Scholastic, 2004) is perfect for storytimes and family sharing.

      bully who is the oldest boy in his fifth-grade class. In this humorous novel
      that tells of Bradley''s learning to like himself and to make friends, Sachar
      ably captures both middle-grade angst and joy. Bradley''s triumph comes through
      the friendship of a new boy at school and the help of the new school counselor.
      Readers, like the astute counselor, can see the strengths that Bradley has,
      and will cheer at his minor victories and cringe at his setbacks along the way.
      The story is unusual, witty, and satisfying, if not always believable: a few
      incidents just do not work. For instance, even though Bradley has not been doing
      his homework, his complete ignorance of it is unlikely (``He hadn''t realized.
      . .he would need to bring his book home''''), and his total unfamiliarity with
      birthday parties is too extreme for a ten year old, even one who hadn''t been

      that the reader seems to be engulfed in actual letters. She also makes Leigh
      quite a round character with many problems that children today can relate to.

      book: its unflinchingly honest portrayal of childhood problems and emotions
      changed children''s literature forever. Happily, it has neither dated nor become
      obsolete and remains one of the best children''s novels ever written. The fascinating
      story is about an intensely curious and intelligent girl, who literally spies
      on people and writes about them in her secret notebook, trying to make sense
      of life''s absurdities. When her classmates find her notebook and read her painfully
      blunt comments about them, Harriet finds herself a lonely outcast. Fitzhugh''s
      writing is astonishingly vivid, real and engaging, and Harriet, by no means
      a typical, loveable heroine, is one of literature''s most unforgettable characters.

      children, and then gets worse. Their misfortunes begin one gray day on Briny
      Beach when Mr. Poe tells them that their parents perished in a fire that destroyed
      their whole house. "It is useless for me to describe to you how terrible Violet,
      Klaus, and even Sunny felt in the time that followed," laments the personable
      (occasionally pedantic) narrator, who tells the story as if his readers are
      gathered around an armchair on pillows. But of course what follows is dreadful.
      The children thought it was bad when the well-meaning Poes bought them grotesque-colored
      clothing that itched. But when they are ushered to the dilapidated doorstep
      of the miserable, thin, unshaven, shiny-eyed, money-grubbing Count Olaf, they
      know that they--and their family fortune--are in real trouble. Still, they could
      never have anticipated how much trouble. While it''s true that the events that
      unfold in Lemony Snicket''s novels are bleak, and things never turn out as you''d
      hope, these delightful, funny, linguistically playful books are reminiscent
      of Roald Dahl (remember James and the Giant Peach and his horrid spinster aunts),
      Charles Dickens (the orphaned Pip in Great Expectations without the mysterious

      Violet, 14; Klaus, 12; and the infant, Sunny. In Bad Beginning, their parents
      and possessions perish in a fire, and the orphans must use their talents to
      survive as their lives move from one disastrous event to another. Surrounded
      by dim-witted though well-meaning adults, the Baudelaires find themselves in
      the care of their evil relative, Count Olaf, a disreputable actor whose main
      concern is getting his hands on the children''s fortune. When Olaf holds Sunny
      hostage to force Violet to marry him, it takes all of the siblings'' resourcefulness
      to outwit him. Violet''s inventive genius, Klaus''s forte for research, and
      Sunny''s gift for biting the bad guys at opportune moments save the day. However,
      the evil Count escapes, only to return in The Reptile Room just as the children
      are settling into a far more pleasant life with their new guardian, Uncle Monty,
      who is promptly murdered by Olaf and his cohorts. Though the villain escapes

      seem daunting, but the inclusion of Snicket''s perceptive definitions of difficult

    - A Note from the Author
    - ! "Dear Reader,\r\nI'm sorry to say that the book you are holding in your hands
      is extremely unpleasant. It tells an unhappy tale about three very unlucky children.
      Even though they are charming and clever, the Baudelaire siblings lead lives
      filled with misery and woe. From the very first page of this book when the children
      are at the beach and receive terrible news, continuing on through the entire
      story, disaster lurks at their heels. One might say they are magnets for misfortune.\r\n\r\nIn
      this short book alone, the three youngsters encounter a greedy and repulsive
      villain, itchy clothing, a disastrous fire, a plot to steal their fortune, and
      cold porridge for breakfast.\r\n\r\nIt is my sad duty to write down these unpleasant
      tales, but there is nothing stopping you from putting this book down at once
      and reading something happy, if you prefer that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nWith all
      due respect,\r\nLemony Snicket"

    - Instinct told them that the way home lay to the west. And so the doughty young
      Labrador retriever, the roguish bull terrier and the indomitable Siamese set
      out through the Canadian wilderness. Separately, they would soon have died.
      But, together, the three house pets faced starvation, exposure, and wild forest
      animals to make their way home to the family they love. The Incredible Journey
      is one of the great children's stories of all time--and has been popular ever
      since its debut in 1961.

    - ! 'Most WW II homefront novels are unambiguous in their approach to patriots
      and traitors, allies and enemies. Hahn''s subtle, thought-provoking work, however,
      proposes the legitimacy of a variety of ethical responses to critical situations.
      Margaret''s brother Jimmy is overseas fighting, and Margaret and her parents
      avidly follow news of Allied advances. She and best friend Elizabeth, united
      in their dislike of Gordy the bully, slowly uncover several ominous secrets:
      Gordy is helping his older brother Stuart, an Army deserter, hide in a weatherworn
      shack in the woods; and Gordy''s father batters his mother, his siblings and
      Gordy himself. At first Margaret and Elizabeth see their discovery of Stuart''s
      shack as a way to "blackmail" Gordy into treating them decently, but when Stuart
      falls dangerously ill, the girls feel obliged to help care for him. Soon they
      begin to reexamine the standard propaganda about the war. While some of her
      characters seem anachronistic and certain developments are unlikely, Hahn succeeds
      in raising questions as valuable as they are vexing.'

      story of a girl''s experiences on the home front during World War II. Margaret,
      11, and her boisterous friend Elizabeth hate the school bully, Gordy. They discover
      that a man living in the woods whom they had thought of as crazy is actually
      Gordy''s gentle brother, who has deserted a war he feels he cannot morally fight.
      When Stuart nearly dies of pneumonia, the girls join forces with Gordy to get
      help and they gain insight into Gordy''s difficult life with his alcoholic,
      abusive father. Well-drawn characters and a satisfying plot keep this from deteriorating
      into a message novel. The issues raised are presented from diverse points of
      view, and no easy answers are given. Margaret struggles with her feelings about
      her brother fighting (and ultimately dying) in a war that Stuart has deserted.
      She realizes, however, that Stuart''s conscientious objection is not the black-and-white,
      coward vs. patriot matter her parents believe it to be. Although clearly set
      in the ''40s with characters that are true to their time, their problems and
      feelings are not dated and should interest today''s readers. There is plenty
      of action and page-turning suspense to please those who want a quick read, but

      Lyddie and her younger brother Charles are hired out as servants, while Mama
      and the two youngest children go off to live with relatives. After spending
      a grueling year working in a tavern, Lyddie flees.. in hopes of finding a better
      job that will provide enough income to pay off farm debts and allow the family
      to be reunited. Life continues to be a struggle after she is employed in a cloth
      factory, but Lyddie finds refuge from wretched working conditions by burying
      herself in books. Learning that she cannot return home--the family farm has
      been sold to Quaker neighbors--the girl is seized by a burning desire to gain
      independence by attending college. Readers will sympathize with Lyddie's hardships
      and admire her determination to create a better life for herself. Paterson clearly
      depicts the effects of poverty during the 19th century, focusing on the plight
      of factory workers enslaved by their dismal jobs.

      brother Kenny's existence. Constantly in trouble for one thing or another, from
      straightening his hair into a \"conk\" to lighting fires to freezing his lips
      to the mirror of the new family car, Byron finally pushes his family too far.
      Before this \"official juvenile delinquent\" can cut school or steal change

      the deep south to spend the summer with his tiny, strict grandmother. Soon the
      whole family is packed up, ready to make the drive from Flint, Michigan, straight
      into one of the most chilling moments in America's history: the burning of the
      Sixteenth Avenue Baptist Church with four little girls inside.\r\n\r\nChristopher

      to the story and invites readers of all ages into his world, even as it changes
      before his eyes. Curtis is also the acclaimed author of Bud, Not Buddy, winner

      Kenny Watson tells about his African American family in Flint, Michigan, in

      who gets into so much trouble his parents decide to take him back "home" to

    - Without portentous stereotypes, Dorris tells a story of a Native American boy
      who leaves home to find himself. Moss isn't sure why he walks away into the
      forest. His life seems stale. What's more, he's mad at his father for inviting
      a group of white strangers to be guests at the village harvest festival. Lost
      and alone, Moss opens up to the natural world and becomes "the forest's welcomed
      guest." He meets a fierce runaway girl, and they help each other get home. Moss
      knows that he hasn't encountered a noble mentor on his vision quest; he hasn't
      suddenly become "a man." What he has found is a new view of himself and the
      world around him. He realizes he has been selfish and inhospitable. And now
      he can see that neither the guests nor the village hosts are comfortable at
      the feast. They can't understand each other. The strangers are hungry, but why
      are they so greedy and grasping? Even for a sensitive boy, Moss seems too articulate
      about his inner journey. But Dorris dramatizes that universal experience of
      feeling stuck at home, as well as the excitement of finding what you didn't
      know was there. As in Morning Girl (1993), the encounter with Europeans is seen
      through the eyes of a young person. Several stirring old creation stories woven
      into the narrative underline Moss' quest for both freedom and responsibility.
      Dorris' casual sentences are simple and beautiful, showing in their very particularity
      that Moss discovers the wonder of familiar things.-Hazel Rochman

    - Moss's father extends his hospitality to a group of strangers who speak an entirely
      different language and who make the boy "uncomfortable with their oddness."
      When his efforts to convince his parents that the guests should not participate
      in his people's harvest feast are rebuked, Moss runs away into the nearby forest.
      There he meets Trouble, a distant relative, and in trying to impress her, finds
      himself forced into his "away time." Lost in the woods, he learns to look and
      listen, and begins to realize what it means to be a man during an encounter
      with a porcupine. He also finds solace in his conversations with Trouble, who
      eventually helps him find his way out of the forest. Though she is struggling
      with the strictures placed upon young women in her clan, they share universal
      early adolescent emotions about the lack of understanding their families afford
      them. Dorris's writing is elegant, full of evocative images and lush metaphors.
      He develops his intriguing characters in a leisurely way, and places little
      emphasis on plot. Young readers will need to work hard to piece together the
      clues that suggest the setting (someplace by the sea) and the identity of the
      guests (probably white settlers since they arrived after following a "trail
      through the sea"). They will be able to comprehend the words, but some may miss
      the story's ultimate meaning.-Ellen Fader

    - A brief look into Native American life just before it is irrevocably changed
      in this rite-of-passage tale of a young Indian boy. Moss is annoyed with his
      father for inviting the strangers--white men--to the village's annual harvest
      festival. He declares that he will not celebrate with the guests and goes to
      the edge of the village to sulk. There he meets Trouble, a girl about his age,
      and boastfully announces that he is going on his ``away time''--a boy's solitary
      journey into the forest to become a man and take a new name. Trouble does not
      believe him, so Moss foolhardily treks alone into the forest to prove her wrong.
      In the forest he learns about life, nature, and beauty from a grouchy old porcupine
      and transforms himself from a selfish little boy into a sensitive young man.
      Moss and Trouble meet again, and this time he shows a real interest in her.
      They develop a bond born of mutual understanding and return to the village to
      share in the festival. Interspersed with Moss's story are Indian legends that
      give the whole an added richness and depth, but the abrupt ending leaves the
      reader dissatisfied. Dorris obscures the simple story by weaving in too many
      threads--the white men, Trouble's troubled homelife--that dangle at the conclusion.
      A book that might have been outstanding had it delivered more or attempted less.

      when it sailed to the top of The New York Times best-seller list for sixty-one
      weeks, won numerous literary awards, including the National Book Award, and
      went on to sell over three million copies. Now, the beloved American epic returns,
      reissued by Grove Press to coincide with the publication of Frazier’s eagerly-anticipated
      second novel, Thirteen Moons. Sorely wounded and fatally disillusioned in the
      fighting at Petersburg, a Confederate soldier named Inman decides to walk back
      to his home in the Blue Ridge mountains to Ada, the woman he loves. His trek
      across the disintegrating South brings him into intimate and sometimes lethal
      converse with slaves and marauders, bounty hunters and witches, both helpful
      and malign. At the same time, the intrepid Ada is trying to revive her father’s
      derelict farm and learning to survive in a world where the old certainties have
      been swept away. As it interweaves their stories, Cold Mountain asserts itself
      as an authentic odyssey, hugely powerful, majestically lovely, and keenly moving.

    - This monumental novel is set at the end of the Civil War and follows the journey
      of a wounded Confederate soldier named Inman as he returns home. Interwoven
      is the story of Ada, the woman he loves. Ada, who was raised in genteel society,
      cannot cope with the rigors of war until a woman called Ruby arrives to help
      her. Inman comes across memorable characters like the goatwoman, who lives off
      the secret herbs in the woods and Sara, a woman stranded with an infant who
      is assaulted by Yankee soldiers whom Inman later kills. After a long, threatening
      journey, Inman finally arrives home to Ada, "ravaged, worn ragged and wary and
      thin." His momentary homecoming, however, comes to a tragic end. A remarkable
      effort that opens up a historical past that will enrich readers not only with
      its story but with its strong characters. Highly recommended for all collections.

    - A grim story about a tough, resourceful Southern family in the Civil War is
      somewhat submerged by the weight of lyrical detail piled on the tale, and by
      the slow pace of the telling. There's no doubt that Frazier can write; the problem
      is that he stops so often to savor the sheer pleasure of the act of writing
      in this debut effort. Inman, seeing that the end of the war is near, decides
      to leave his regiment and go back home to Ada, the bright, stubborn woman he
      loves. His adventures traversing a chaotic, impoverished land, Ada's struggles
      to preserve her father's farm, and the harsh, often powerful tales of the rough-hewn
      individuals they encounter take up most of the narrative. The tragic climax
      is convincing but somewhat rushed, given the many dilatory scenes that have
      preceded it. Frazier has Cormac McCarthy's gift for rendering the pitch and
      tang of regional speech, and for catching some of the true oddity of human nature,
      but he doesn't yet possess McCarthy's ferocious focus. A promising but overlong,
      uneven debut.

    - McCourt is the eldest of eight children born to Angela Sheehan and Malachy McCourt
      in the 1920s. The McCourts began their family in poverty in Brooklyn, yet when
      Angela slipped into depression after the death of her only daughter (four of
      eight children survived), the family reversed the tide of emigration and returned
      to Ireland, living on public assistance in Limerick. McCourt's story is laced
      with the pain of extreme poverty, aggravated by an alcoholic father who abandoned
      the family during World War II. Given the burdens of grief and starvation, it's
      a tribute to his skill that he can serve the reader a tale of love, some sadness,
      but at least as much laughter as the McCourts' "Yankee" children knew growing
      up in the streets of Limerick. His story, almost impossible to put down, may
      well become a classic. A wonderful book; strongly recommended for readers of
      any age.

      Limerick, Ireland: three of his siblings did not, dying of minor illnesses complicated
      by near starvation. Even more astonishing is how generous of spirit he became
      and remains. His family lived--barely--in a flat so miserable that every year
      they had to cram themselves into an upstairs room when winter floods made the
      place only half-habitable. That upstairs room was "Italy" --warm and dry. Downstairs
      was Ireland--wet and cold. Father sat up there drinking tea, while mother Angela
      often could not rise from bed, so depressed was she. Or mother sat by the fire,
      waiting for father to return; when he did, frequently drunk on their little
      money, he would line up the boys and extract promises that they would die for
      Ireland. Dying was what everyone seemed to do best: the little sister, the twins,
      the girl with whom Frank first had sex, the old man Frank read to, too many
      boys from school, too many neighbors, too many relatives. McCourt spares us
      no details: the stench of the one toilet shared by an entire street, the insults
      of the charity officers, the maurauding rats, the street fights, the infected
      eyes, the fleas in the mattress . . . Yet he found a way to love in that miserable
      Limerick, and it is love one remembers as the dominant flavor in this Irish
      stew. Many a lesser book gets the kind of publicity push that McCourt''s memoir
      is happily slated to receive. Expect demand, not only from those seduced by
      blurbs and interviews, but from word-of-mouth thereafter.-Patricia Monaghan'

      hero, yet there''s no arguing with its track record: first Nero Wolfe and now
      Inspector Morse, the curmudgeonly Oxford copper who is currently the darling
      of the PBS crime set. The wild popularity of the Morse novels, both in print

      to extend his audience beyond the cozy crowd. This time, the murders are particularly
      bloody (the sensitive Morse barely deigns to examine the bodies), and the trail
      leads directly to those nasty Oxford dons, mired in yet another power squabble.
      Morse intuits the solution as always, but not before a personal crisis intervenes:
      too much beer has resulted in a spot of diabetes. The inspector''s fans will
      positively swoon at the way their gruff hero talks back to the nurses and continues

      A boy evacuee moves in with them. Lily's rocks during this unsettled time are
      her cat, Tips, and the friendship she strikes up with a black American soldier,
      Adolphus, better known as Adie. Decades later, Lily sees Adie and his son on
      the beach. Their friendship is rekindled and, after her husband's death, she
      visits him in Atlanta, GA. As the story ends in the present, she tells her grandchild
      that she and Adie have just married and that she is bringing him home to London
      with her. This is an appealing story, but it has a nostalgic quality that may
      limit its interest to children.

    - Following a grandson's memories of riding on a motorbike with his beloved grandmother,
      Lily, this story goes back in time to Lily's journal entries, made during World
      War II in Britain, which show her as a fiercely independent person even then--as
      angry at her family as she is at the enemy. Lily, 12, feels guilty about quarreling
      with Dad before he left to fight (what if he gets killed?), but her most immediate
      concern is finding her beloved cat, Tips, which goes missing after the family
      is forced to evacuate its coastal farm to make room for the army to rehearse
      the invasion of Normandy. She is helped by a kind, black GI, Adolphus ("Adie"),
      with whom she develops a bond. The personal story of anger and love is as gripping
      as the war drama, and Morpurgo includes a fascinating note about the invasion
      rehearsal and why its history is seldom told.-Hazel Rochman

    - ! 'Precious Ramotswe is on the case again in this delightful fifth installment
      in the bestselling No. 1 Ladies'' Detective Agency series, this time assisting
      the self-made founder of a chain of hairdressing salons who wants to unearth
      the real intentions of her four suitors, each possibly more interested in her
      money than her heart. As fans know, though, sleuthing takes second place to
      folksy storytelling in McCall Smith''s wry novels. This time around, Mma Ramotswe
      is distracted by her long-prolonged engagement to Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, Gaborone''s
      best mechanic; it seems she will never be married, despite her fiancé''s honorable
      intentions. He installs an extra large seatbelt in her car to keep her safe
      (she is quite comfortable with her "traditional build," despite the new, slender
      fashion of modern woman), but an altercation with another mechanic and the prospect
      of a charity parachute jump keep his mind off matrimony. A drive for decency
      motivates Mma Ramotswe and her friends-among them Mma Potokwani, the imperious
      matron of the local orphan farm, and Mma Makutsi, assistant at the Ladies''
      Detective Agency and founder of the Kalahari Typing School for Men-and Smith''s
      talent is in portraying this moral code in a manner that is always engaging.
      As readers will appreciate, Mma Ramotswe solves her cases-more questions of
      character, really, than of criminal behavior-in good time. Traditionally built
      ladies living in the African heat don''t tend to hurry, and, at the No. 1 Ladies
      Detective Agency, there''s always time for another cup of tea. '

    - In this fifth installment about the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, Mma Ramotswe
      and her assistant, Mma Makutsi, tackle the case of a wealthy woman who wants
      to know which of her suitors is only after her money. On a personal note, Mma
      Ramotswe worries over when her fiancé will set a date for their marriage, and
      more urgently, who will replace him in performing the parachute jump, a charity
      event to raise money for the Orphan Farm. The charm of this series set in Botswana
      is its wealth of very real characters. By Western standards they may be economically
      poor, but in terms of pride, love, and happiness, they are rich indeed. Readers
      will be seduced by the beauty of the land and intrigued by local customs. They
      will learn about drought and irrigation, about growing pumpkins, braiding hair,
      and dealing with poisonous snakes. The cases Mma Ramotswe handles are more about
      solving problems than crimes. Her behavior is governed by good manners, politeness,
      and honesty, and her favorite tool in the art of detecting is tea, preferably
      Bush Tea. The book has lots of humor, and optimism softens the tough realities
      of life. It also has a delightful surprise ending.

      1985, both Dutton), McPhail provides a simple, enjoyable solution to a hectic
      or otherwise troublesome situation. This time, Emma is on vacation with her
      parents. But while her parents need to fill their days sightseeing rather than
      interacting with each other, Emma would rather spend her vacation going on a
      picnic, taking walks, singing songs, and telling stories. In the end, Emma wins
      out, and her parents learn what relaxing and a family vacation are all about.
      The soft watercolor illustrations give a peaceful feeling to this short, humorous
      story. This story would be a welcome addition to preschool storyhours, and the

    - George uses a journal approach to illuminate the first 10+ months of life for
      three wolf pups born to an alpine tundra pack. Each entry in the "diary" is
      prefaced with a message (in colored inks) to readers/listeners living south
      of the area telling them how to keep "tundra-time" in the framework of their
      own seasons. "When you see dandelions turning silver...." "When the yellow warblers
      return...." "When you are eating fresh blueberries...." Then, George writes,
      "Look to the north" and in the following paragraph(s), she describes the pups,
      their gradual development, and their environment. The lyrical text is accompanied
      by large, realistic acrylic paintings of the adult wolves, the pups, and their
      habitat along with small cameos of the southern reminders?a clump of dandelions,
      a yellow warbler (the illustrator should consult a Peterson guide), ripe blueberries,
      etc. The author's research is impeccable, and her affection for her subject
      evident, affirmed in a personal note. Children will take pleasure in the simply
      worded narrative and the warm pictures, and will store some accurate wolf data
      in their memories, as well as take stronger note of their own habitats as they
      keep an eye out for dandelions, for fresh blueberries on the table, and for
      Halloween jack-o-lanterns on front porches

    - Imagine coming upon a fountain of youth in a forest. To live forever--isn't
      that everyone's ideal? For the Tuck family, eternal life is a reality, but their
      reaction to their fate is surprising. Award winner Natalie Babbitt (Knee-Knock
      Rise, The Search for Delicious) outdoes herself in this sensitive, moving adventure
      in which 10-year-old Winnie Foster is kidnapped, finds herself helping a murderer
      out of jail, and is eventually offered the ultimate gift--but doesn't know whether
      to accept it. Babbitt asks profound questions about the meaning of life and
      death, and leaves the reader with a greater appreciation for the perfect cycle
      of nature. Intense and powerful, exciting and poignant, Tuck Everlasting will
      last forever--in the reader's imagination.

      Things are going from bad to worse as he finds true love in the form of Fleurette
      Featherstone Fitchell and true hate in the form of the elitist Hi-Y club. Life
      looks fairly grim for this lad, his friends, and his guardian, Mrs. O'Driscoll,
      but the fortunes are smiling on this hapless orphan, and he is canny enough
      to nod his head and smile right back. The story takes place in post-World War
      II Canada where society cruelly draws the lines between rich and poor. Doyle's
      writing takes star billing in this perfectly crafted, rollicking read. The narrative
      is colorful, with some delightfully comic moments, and the story and language
      are completely accessible to teens. The character list at the end with brief
      Hubboized synopses is a fun way to wrap up this great rags-to-riches tale with
      a surprising twist at the end.

    - Adorable illustrations create the magic for this simple, sweet story of Lola,
      a hamster, and the day she searches for the right time to say, "I love you."
      Especially charming pictures show Lola's cheeks puffed out with love as she
      drags a blanket down the hallway, where (on the next page) she sees her mother
      and father kiss good-bye. Later, her mother is too busy for special words, and
      the school bus is too noisy. Lola's growing frustration over her inability to
      express herself is delightfully drawn. Each picture shows the little creature
      more and more distraught, until she finally explodes with emotion at dinnertime.
      Lola's parents respond generously with kisses, and all is well until bedtime
      when Lola worries whether her special words will be back on her lips in the
      morning. I Love You So Much deserves a place beside the numerous other books
      that deal with the expression of family love because this endearing little hamster
      finds as much satisfaction in declaring love as in hearing it.

      I Love You? (1995, not reviewed), this book stars Lola, a nut-brown hamster
      who could be an adopted cousin of Nutbrown Hare. Lola feels words puffing out
      her cheeks, bursting inside her, but when she tries to express her special words,
      her father is leaving for work and her mother is too busy. The school bus, cafeteria,
      and playground are too noisy for the words to be heard, and the teacher is preoccupied.
      Lola returns home and sulks until the words unwittingly ``came flying out of
      her mouth and worked their magic.'' It's no surprise that Lola's special words
      are ``I love you, I love you! I love you so much!'' Hugs abound among the puffy-cheeked
      rodents in this mushy, overstated tale and its greeting-card message.

      himself for not being able to save her. Older brother Ty'ree is more mature
      and responsible but he, too, is tormented by the past. He witnessed his father
      rescue a drowning woman and later die of hypothermia before Lafayette was born,

      It's a story of poverty and grief, of family secrets and brotherly love. Lafayette's
      oldest brother, Ty'ree, has given up hope of college so that he can work and
      raise Lafayette and their middle brother, Charlie, who robbed a local candy
      store two years ago and has returned home from the correctional facility an
      angry stranger. Charlie is now in trouble again; this time it's a gang fight.
      With the boys always is the absence of their beloved mother and the guilt, blame,
      and sorrow they all feel and incite in one another. Mama is too saintly a figure,
      at least in her three sons' soft-glowing sorrowful memories, but the fast-paced
      narrative is physically immediate, and the dialogue is alive with anger and
      heartbreak, "brother to brother to brother." As in Walter Dean Myers' novel

    - PreSchool-Grade 2?Lilly loves everything about school?even the squeaky chalk
      and the cafeteria food. But most of all, she loves her teacher, Mr. Slinger,
      who is a sharp dresser and greets his students with an uncharacteristic "Howdy."
      The little mouse will do anything for him?until he refuses to allow her to interrupt
      lessons to show the class her new movie-star sunglasses, three shiny quarters,
      and purple plastic purse. Seething with anger, she writes a mean story about
      him and places it in his book bag at the end of the day. But when she looks
      in her purse, she discovers that he has written her a kind note and even left
      her a bag of treats. Filled with remorse, Lilly sets out to make amends. Rich
      vocabulary and just the right amount of repetition fuse perfectly with the watercolor
      and black-pen illustrations. With a few deft strokes, Henkes changes Lilly's
      facial expressions and body language to reveal a full range of emotions. When
      she realizes how unfair she has been, Lilly shrinks smaller and smaller. When
      all ends well, she leaps for joy in her familiar red boots right out of the
      picture's frame. Clever dialogue and other funny details will keep readers looking
      and laughing. As the cover and end papers attest, Lilly emerges once again a
      star

    - ! "Lilly is back, and in school. She loves everything about it, especially her
      wonderful teacher, Mr. Slinger. One morning Lilly is happier than ever because
      her grandmother has given her movie star sunglasses, three shiny quarters, and
      a purple plastic purse that plays a tune when it's opened. She's dying to show
      her new things to her friends. But when she talks out of turn and distracts
      the class, Mr. Slinger confiscates her treasures for the day. Suddenly he becomes
      \"BIG FAT MEAN MR. STEALING TEACHER!\" in Lilly's eyes, and she leaves him a
      note telling him so. Then she finds Mr. Slinger's own note to her, along with
      some snacks: \"Today was a difficult day./Tomorrow will be better.\" Helped
      by her parents, a remorseful Lilly manages a heartwarming reconciliation with
      her teacher.\r\n\r\nHenkes once again demonstrates his direct line to the roller-coaster
      emotions of small children. With a slightly more complicated plot than those
      of Lilly's previous adventures, this one employs understated humor throughout.
      The illustrations do an exceptional job of amplifying the text: Lilly dances
      with excitement, flashes with anger, wanes in remorse, and leaps right off the
      page with joy."

    - The irrepressible mouse heroine of Chester's Way and Julius, the Baby of the
      World returns for another true-to-life and very funny episode. Lilly loves everything
      about school, especially her teacher, Mr. Slinger--until he takes away her musical
      purse because she can't stop playing with it in class. Lilly decides to get
      revenge with a nasty drawing of "Big Fat Mean Mr. Stealing Teacher!" but when
      she finds the kind note he put in her purse, she's filled with remorse and has
      to find a way to make things right again. Children will sympathize with Lilly's
      impulsive mistake and laugh uproariously at the witty and expressive pictures
      of the very human mice. In a starred review, Publisher's Weekly called this
      book "sympathetic and wise."

    - The 26 characters in this rhythmic, rhyming baby book are a lowercase alphabet
      with attitude. "A told b, and b told c, 'I'll meet you at the top of the coconut
      tree'"--which probably seemed like a good idea until the other 23 members of
      the gang decided to follow suit. Lois Ehlert's chunky block illustrations show
      the luxuriant green palm standing straight and tall on the first page, but it
      begins to groan and bend under its alphabetical burden. First the coconuts fall
      off, then ("Chicka chicka... BOOM! BOOM!") all the letters also end up in a
      big heap underneath. A very simple board-book version stops there, but this
      original text goes on to introduce the helping hands of the 26 uppercase "mamas
      and papas and uncles and aunts."

    - ! 'In this bright and lively rhyme, the letters of the alphabet race each other
      to the top of the coconut tree. When X, Y and Z finally scramble up the trunk,
      however, the weight is too much, and down they all tumble in a colorful chaotic
      heap: "Chicka Chicka . . . BOOM! BOOM!" All the family members race to help,
      as one by one the letters recover in amusingly battered fashion. Poor stubbed
      toe E has a swollen appendage, while F sports a jaunty Band-Aid and P is indeed
      black-eyed. As the tropic sun goes down and a radiant full moon appears, indomitable
      A leaps out of bed, double-daring his colleagues to another treetop race. This
      nonsense verse delights with its deceptively simple narrative and with the repetition
      of such catchy phrases as "skit skat skoodle doot." Ehlert''s bold color scheme,
      complete with hot pink and orange borders, matches the crazy mood perfectly.
      Children will revel in seeing the familiar alphabet transported into this madcap
      adventure.'

    - Kevin Henkes's charming story (Greenwillow Books, 1988) of two friends who are
      truly "two peas in a pod" comes to life in this quality production. Chester
      and Wilson do everything the same way, from cutting sandwiches to playing baseball.
      Then Lilly, of purple plastic purse fame, moves into the neighborhood. Lilly
      has her own way of doing things, and Chester and Wilson don't know quite what
      to make of her until the day she uses one of her disguises to frighten off some
      misbehaving older boys. Chester and Wilson look at Lilly in a new light, and
      discover that the three of them have more in common than they previously believed,
      and that perhaps different ways of doing things are just fine.

    - Cara Landry, entering as a new fifth-grade student in Mr. Larson's class, is
      quiet and unassuming. Barely noticed by classmates or her teacher, she publishes
      her first edition of the Landry News creating a transformation of teacher, students,
      and even herself. Her editorial states simply, "There is a teacher in the classroom,
      but he does not teach." Emerging from years of disillusionment, he begins to
      teach again. Journalism with all its ramifications and responsibilities are
      his tools. All the fifth-graders decide to help Cara publish the Landry News
      regularly as their class project. This gives the principal just the right tool
      to rid himself of Mr. Larson something he has waited for patiently. What begins
      as a small school conflict grows into a First Amendment Rights issue that solidifies
      friendships for, and love of Mr. Larson. As in Frindle, author Andrew Clements
      uses an everyday classroom setting to illuminate words and their importance.
      Using clear and simple sentence structure, hard issues such as divorce, loyalty,
      and responsibility are presented with sensitivity and a lot of humor. [Readers]
      will appreciate Cara's visit to the principal's office and her gauge, the "mad-o-meter,"
      to assess the situation. Academic issues summarized such as newspaper analysis,
      the Constitution, and the First Amendment are introduced and briefly summarized.
      This is an enjoyable story that also provides a great deal of information on
      some important and current issues.

      as the Little Princess screams, "I want my dinner!" The picture of her red-faced
      temper tantrum, complete with silverware flying through the air, shows more
      than the text reveals. Next, she demands her potty (while squeezing toothpaste
      all over the cat). Finally, she remembers to say the magic word when she requests
      her teddy bear. Then, on a walk, she encounters a big, red-nosed blue Beastie.
      He pitches a fit about wanting his dinner, and the Little Princess tells him
      to say please. The smiling, yellow-crowned child reminds him to say thank you,
      too. The simple text combined with exuberant, colorful watercolors show Ross
      at his best. Any child who has been reminded to be courteous will appreciate
      the cheerful, comical illustrations.

    - Leigh Botts, the protagonist of the Newbery winner Dear Mr. Henshaw (Morrow,
      1983), is once again recording his thoughts on paper. While cleaning his room,
      he discovers his old diary and is inspired to start writing again. Now 14, he
      is still dealing with some of the same issues from earlier days--his parents'
      divorce, concerns about his father's sincerity and financial stability, and
      insecurities about his own identity and popularity. He also has a few new worries--namely
      Geneva, a girl, and Strider, a dog. Leigh and his friend Barry find the abandoned
      pooch on the beach and decide to try "joint custody." It is not the perfect
      arrangement. Because Leigh's attachment to Strider fills the emotional voids
      in his life, he becomes reluctant to share him. Eventually, the two boys work
      through the tensions that threaten their friendship. At the same time, Leigh
      and his father develop a new understanding. Although the story is centered aroung
      Leigh's relationship with Strider, this is more than just "a boy and his dog"
      book. Cleary's talent for portraying the details of everyday life--both small
      and significant--is evident here. Her characters are unique individuals and
      "every children" at the same time. Strider lacks the subtle poignancy found
      in Dear Mr. Henshaw , and some readers may find Leigh's interest and responses
      more appropriate for an 11 or 12 year old than a 14 year old, but Cleary's fans
      will relate to his challenges and triumphs--whether or not they've read the
      first title.

    - Leigh Botts, of Newbery-winning Dear Mr. Henshaw, is still learning to cope
      with his parents' divorce--a task to which he brings his earlier sensitivity
      and a new self-confidence. Now 14 and entering high school, Leigh and best-friend
      Barry find an appealing abandoned dog on the beach and name him Strider. Both
      boys would like to keep him; Barry's large, amiable family could easily accommodate
      Strider, but Barry--realizing how much Leigh wants the dog despite the probability
      that his landlady will object--suggests a unique joint custody. The arrangement
      works beautifully until Barry goes away for his annual month with his mom; when
      he comes back, Leigh's reluctance to share Strider cools their friendship--until
      the boys finally level with each other and work out a new deal that recognizes
      Leigh's greater need and affection for the dog. The action, as described in
      Leigh's diary, pivots around Strider; meanwhile, however, family relationships
      (especially Leigh's with his dad) are subtly growing and maturing in trademark
      Cleary style, the accessible, lightly humorous surface just one of the levels
      of an insightful story about idiosyncratic but nice characters dealing with
      universal issues. A sequel that could stand on its own (but won't have to);
      a comforting picture of a dear old friend thriving while continuing to work
      out his problems. Zelinsky's perceptive drawings are an excellent bonus.

      in Redwall Abbey--and breaks their spell forever. The fast-paced, meaty text
      jumps from Redwall to Sampetra to the high seas, each time leaving readers on
      the edge of their seats, until gradually the various branches of the story converge
      in a glorious climax. With several strong female characters, fewer battles,
      and more mystery--as well as the usual complement of humorous sidekicks and
      mouthwatering feasts--this is a victory for Redwall.

    - Devoted fans of Jacques's "Redwall Tales" will snap this off the shelf without
      any prompting. And those readers who have not yet discovered the delights of
      Redwall Abbey will likely be converted by the time they have finished reading
      this rollicking adventure set within the abbey walls, around Mossflower Woods,
      and on the tropical Island of Samptera, populated by vermin corsairs; Trident-rats;
      and the evil Emperor Ublaz Mad Eyes, a pine martin. The Pearls of Lutra, a set
      of six pink pearls known as the Tears of All Oceans plundered from the Otters
      of Holt Lutra, have slipped through the malevolent Ublaz's paws. He sends a
      crew of rough Wave Brethern and creepy monitor lizards to recover them from
      Redwall Abbey, where they have ended up by chance. In the course of events,
      the beloved Abbot Durral is kidnapped, and Martin the Warrior and a group of
      charming, valiant, and ravenous beasts from Redwall and Mossflower sail off
      to save him. In the meantime, the determined hogmaid Tansy and her friends must
      use the riddlelike clues to recover the pearls from the six spots where they
      were hidden by the now-deceased Fermaid the Ancient. Although good triumphs
      over evil as always, readers will experience heartache and some scary moments,
      as well as encounter quite a bit of bloodshed along the way. A welcome addition
      to the Redwall canon and a good, solid recommendation for filling adventure-
      book assignments.

    - Kindergarten-Grade 4 - Beautifully illustrated in two distinct styles, this
      book introduces readers to a Zen approach to the world, wrapped in a story about
      three siblings and their new neighbor, a panda. One by one, the children visit
      Stillwater, enjoying his company and listening to him tell a brief tale that
      illustrates a Zen principle. Each time, there is a link between the conversation
      shared by Stillwater and his visitor and the story he tells; it's somewhat tenuous
      in regard to the two older siblings, quite specific in the case of Karl, the
      youngest. The tales invite the children to consider the world and their perceptions
      from a different angle; for Karl, the panda's story gently but pointedly teaches
      the benefits of forgiveness. Richly toned and nicely detailed watercolors depict
      the "real world" scenes, while those accompanying the Zen lessons employ black
      lines and strokes on pastel pages to create an interesting blend of Western
      realism and more evocative Japanese naturalism. Taken simply as a picture book,
      Zen Shorts is interesting and visually lovely. As an introduction to Zen, it
      is a real treat, employing familiar imagery to prod children to approach life
      and its circumstances in profoundly "un-Western" ways. An author's note discusses
      the basic concept of Zen and details the sources of Stillwater's stories. Appealing
      enough for a group read-aloud, but also begging to be shared and discussed by
      caregiver and child, Zen Shorts is a notable achievement.

    - ! '*Starred Review* K-Gr. 3. ..Muth''s latest is both an accessible, strikingly
      illustrated story and a thought-provoking meditation. Here he incorporates short
      Buddhist tales, "Zen Shorts," into a story about three contemporary children.
      One rainy afternoon, a giant panda appears in the backyard of three siblings.
      Stillwater, the Panda, introduces himself, and during the next few days, the
      children separately visit him. Stillwater shares an afternoon of relaxing fun
      with each child; he also shares Zen stories, which give the children new views
      about the world and about each other. Very young listeners may not grasp the
      philosophical underpinnings of Stillwater''s tales, but even kids who miss the
      deeper message will enjoy the spare, gentle story of siblings connecting with
      one another. Lush, spacious watercolors of charming Stillwater and the open
      neighborhood will entrance children, as will the dramatic black-and-white pictures
      of the comical animal characters that illustrated Stillwater''s Zen stories.
      Muth doesn''t list sources for the tales, but his author''s note offers more
      commentary about Zen. Stillwater''s questions will linger (Can misfortune become
      good luck? What is the cost of anger?), and the peaceful, uncluttered pictures,
      like the story itself, will encourage children to dream and fill in their own
      answers. '

    - A tenderhearted story told in spare, free-verse poems. Annie, 12, takes great
      pleasure in running, but has no interest in racing or becoming a member of a
      team. For her, the pure joy comes from feeling the earth beneath her bare feet
      and the wind in her face. The experience is totally different for her moody
      friend and running partner, Max. For him, running is a way to escape his personal
      problems. Annie's comfortable, tightly knit world begins to unravel when she
      learns that her mother is pregnant and she becomes increasingly aware that her
      beloved Grandpa, a former champion racer, is slipping into dementia. She is
      a resourceful, self-possessed kid who takes comfort in the familiar but is able
      to face change and take it in stride. She marvels at the new life taking shape
      in her midst (her father provides month-by-month summations of the baby's development)
      and mourns the loss of her grandfather's strong and nurturing wisdom. School,
      art class, and chores appear throughout the verses, creating an everyday rhythm
      that matches the footfalls of this engaging heroine who loves to move, but who
      is willing to stop and smell the roses. Readers will enjoy meeting Annie, her
      family, and friends and will appreciate her resilience and spirit. This is vintage
      Creech, and its richness lies in its sheer simplicity.

      Annie, the free-spirited, ruminative narrator of Creech''s second novel in verse.
      Annie''s nonconformist outlook has raised tensions with her running buddy, Max,
      who can''t understand why Annie won''t join him on the track team. In the meantime,
      Annie''s mother is pregnant, which thrills Annie but brings her grandfather''s
      failing health into painful focus. In the midst of these shifting relationships,
      a creative teacher''s school assignment offers solace and, as in Love That Dog
      (2001), an opportunity for self-discovery: Annie must draw a single apple each
      day for 100 days. The symbolism of the apple seems belabored, and the story''s
      gentle momentum will probably hook only the most thoughtful young readers. But
      like the apple Annie draws, this story is a lovingly crafted, miniature landscape,

    - In this latest "Redwall" entry, Tammo, a young hare, becomes a member of a contingent
      of fighting forest folk who seek to defend the imperiled Redwall Abbey, led
      by the badger Lady Cregga Rose Eyes. Tammo and his comrades do battle against
      the Rapscallion foe, whose leader is the evil greatrat, Damug Warfang. Eventually
      the forces of good meet and clash with their evil enemies in a battle of legendary
      proportions. Good triumphs, of course, but not before several noble warriors
      have met their deaths. There is a tremendous amount of violence in this book.
      The characters maintain some of their animal characteristics, but it is their
      human qualities that make them either appealing or repugnant. The bad Rapscallions
      are thoroughly dishonest, traitorous, and cruel. The badgers, mice, hedgehogs,
      moles, and other assorted creatures that represent goodness may have foibles
      but they are unremittingly kind and generous. Pen-and-ink thumbnail sketches
      appear at the head of each chapter and strongly communicate the sense of drama.
      Some of the creatures, most notably the laboring class of moles, speak in an
      impossible, jaw-breaking dialect that may slow some readers down a bit; nevertheless,
      this is a worthy addition to a series that has found a definite niche among
      fantasy lovers. It breaks no new ground, but it is a satisfying adventure with
      a comforting, predictable conclusion. Its closing lines pave the way for yet
      another sequel.

      a 64-page love story that is equally sweet and silly. For years, Mr. Hoppy has
      leaned over his balcony rail to gaze longingly at Mrs. Silver, who lives one
      floor below him. But all of her attention and affection is showered upon her
      pet tortoise, Alfie. Although the creature seems content, his devoted owner
      is concerned because he has gained a mere three ounces in the 11 years she has
      owned him. When the distressed Mrs. Silver tells her neighbor that she will
      be his "slave for life" if he can find a way to make Alfie grow, the determined
      Mr. Hoppy devises an elaborate scheme to make her think the tortoise is growing.
      (Since tortoises, according to Mr. Hoppy, are backward creatures that "can only

    - Grade 3-6-- What is this? A love story by Dahl? By the master of the malign,
      the nabob of the nasty, the king of the coarse, the baron of the body function?
      Can it truly be he? Well, in a word . . . yes--it can. And to those who still
      disbelieve, it's a sweetly insouciant love story at that. For years, old Mr.
      Hoppy has loved his neighbor, Mrs. Silver, a widow who, alas, only has eyes
      for her pet tortoise, Alfie. The details of how her wish that Alfie would grow
      a little faster inspires Mr. Hoppy to win the widow's heart will not be divulged
      here (but it has something to do with the fact that "Esio Trot" is "tortoise"
      spelled backward). There's not much room for character development in this slender
      story, but Blake's jauntily scribbled illustrations are--as always--the perfect
      comic complement and manage to give even Alfie a personality.

      father any boy ever had." Danny feels very lucky. He adores his life with his
      father, living in a gypsy caravan, listening to his stories, tending their gas
      station, puttering around the workshop, and occasionally taking off to fly home-built
      gas balloons and kites. His father has raised him on his own, ever since Danny''s
      mother died when he was four months old. Life is peaceful and wonderful... until
      he turns 9 and discovers his father''s one vice. Soon Danny finds himself the
      mastermind behind the most incredible plot ever attempted against nasty Victor
      Hazell, a wealthy landowner with a bad attitude. Can they pull it off? If so,
      Danny will truly be the champion of the world. Danny is right up to Roald Dahl''s
      impishly brilliant standards. An intense and beautiful father-son relationship
      is balanced with sublegal high jinks that will have even the most rigid law-abider
      rooting them on. Dahl''s inimitable way with words leaves the reader simultaneously
      satisfied and itching for more. '

      and Ashok Rajagopalan doesn’t quite stop with just the name.\r\n\r\nThe story
      of the big temple elephant catching a cold after getting wet in the rain is
      testimony to a vivid imagination, and what happens thereafter is testimony to
      the author/illustrator’s tangible sense of humour. Gajapati Kulapati’s every
      sneeze causes pandemonium, ending with the wise counsel of a grandmother to
      build a shed for the temple elephant.\r\n\r\nThe success of this story is in
      its narrative. Ashok relies heavily on the natural rhythm of words and sounds
      and places them cleverly on the page. So if there is a pachaak when the banana
      falls on the postman's head, then there is a damaal when the postman falls on
      the cow.\r\n\r\nThe sneeze itself portrays many avatars on the page, sometimes
      even compromising on another scene's presentation. So if one page of the story
      is neatly spaced out, the other is cramped. The rhythm Ashok captures so wonderfully
      with his words is sadly missing in the overall layout, with even the illustrations
      taking a backseat.\r\n\r\nGajapati Kulapati is clearly a story to be read out
      loud, giving your child the wonderful gift of playing with and discovering the
      infinite sounds of words, peppered with the unmistakable stamp of laughter."

      name often with delight. This is the story of a temple elephant who presumably
      lived without any shelter, and without any shackles either. So, this gentle
      elephant who’d been braving the elements (should we call him an elemental elephant?)
      caught a cold one day. Big nose, therefore big cold. Big cold, therefore big
      – and loud – sneeze. And oh boy, did the elephant sneeze! Hoosh, he went, and
      Pachak, went the banana-sellers bananas, flying out and landing on the postman’s
      head.\r\n\r\nDamaal!!!\r\n\r\nThe postman then fell on a poor cow. The sneeze
      had disastrous consequences on the village people (and animals). Poor GK was
      so traumatised by what he had done (even though it really wasn’t his fault),
      he hid behind the temple wall. In the middle of the night he let out another
      loud sneeze, which somehow cured his cold. Finally, it took a wise old grandmother
      to declare that they should build him a house so he wouldn’t have to stay out
      in the rain again. And that made him the happiest elephant in the world. Ummmm.\r\n\r\nShouldn’t
      they have just tried releasing him into the wild? Or not captured him in the
      first place…..? Oh well. As long as he did not sneeze again!!-- Nita Deb"

    - ! "Ever since the time I worked on a textless, illustrated book, I've been wanting
      to do a second one. That was in 1986 and the book, published by the National
      Book Trust, was called Visit to the City Market. That book marked an important
      milestone for me as an illustrator: it was the first one for which I was both
      the author and illustrator.\r\n\r\nCity Market doesn't have much of a story:
      a mother and her two children take a walk to the market, buying things along
      the way – and that's all that happens. But as they go from one shop to the next,
      the reader gets to look at the different kinds of shops they go to, the shopkeepers
      they talk to and the things that they buy. As it happens, I don't like going
      shopping! At the same time I realize that we all need to go now and then. So
      my reason for drawing a visit to the market was to try to make it seem like
      fun. Drawing something is a bit like getting to know it very well. And when
      you know something well, it's easier to like it.\r\n\r\nTwenty years later,
      I STILL don't like going shopping! So maybe that's the reason I still wanted
      to draw a similar book. This time, however, I wanted to look at the whole street,
      not just separate shops and I wanted to show more people than I had in the first
      book. Actually, at the time I was working on the drawings for City Market, that
      was my original plan: I had drawn the whole street and all the buildings with
      dozens of different activities taking place on each page. But in order to do
      that, I had to draw the people very small, which made it hard to see them –
      and harder still for me to draw and colour them. So I abandoned that earlier
      idea and drew the book with larger figures and just a few shops.\r\n\r\nWhile
      preparing to draw Where's that Cat? I had an idea about a child searching for
      a pet cat. The reason is simple: cats are very independent minded creatures,
      and they DO wander away from their homes to go on short adventures. Of course
      we don't usually get to see where they go and what they do … but if I could
      show a child looking for the cat, not only would that give us a chance to look
      at all the places the child goes to, but we might also catch a glimpse of where
      the cat goes.\r\n\r\nRight until the time I began working on this book, I had
      thought of the child as a little boy. Somehow, just after I had talked to Tulika
      about the idea for the book the little boy turned into a little girl. There
      is no explanation for things like that! They just happen.\r\n"

    - Grade 6-10-Yep uses the lively storytelling techniques of his "Dragon" fantasy-adventure
      novels to re-create a stirring historical event-here, the construction of the
      transcontinental railroad. Serpent's Children (1984) and Mountain Light (1985,
      both HarperCollins) described the political and natural disasters that led to
      widespread famine in 19th-century Southern China. Cassia and Foxfire, the "Serpent's
      Children," came from a long line of revolutionaries. Foxfire followed his dreams
      across the sea to the "Golden Mountain," California, where he earned enough
      money to revitalize his village. Dragon's Gate opens in China with Foxfire making
      a triumphant visit home. Otter, Cassia's adopted son, who tells the story, worships
      his uncle and longs to follow him back to the Golden Mountain. Granted his wish
      at last, Otter finds Foxfire working on "Snow Tiger," a mountain in the Sierra
      Nevada range, where Chinese laborers strive to hew a tunnel through solid rock.
      Appalled by the living conditions and disillusioned with his uncle, Otter must
      struggle to survive racial prejudice, cold, starvation, the foreman's whip,
      and the dangers of frostbite and avalanche while trying to reconcile his ideals
      and dreams with harsh reality, and to find his place in a strange land. Combining
      believable characters with thrilling adventure, Yep convinces readers that the
      Chinese railroad workers were indeed men to match the towering mountains of
      the west. Because the first few chapters, set in China, may be a bit confusing
      to children who have not read the previous two books, this will likely need
      booktalking.

      a magical kingfisher who is held captive in human form by her mortal husband,
      but who is later helped by her daughter. She soon joins her mother in the stars,

    - ! "Imagine that a child is given the activity of writing in a scrapbook all
      that (s)he knows about a favourite relative, with her special memories and feelings
      about that relative. Imagine that the child is provided with lots of colouring
      and writing material, and all the photographs that can be found about the person
      in question. And there is no rush to finish the project, time enough for the
      child to reflect and marshall all thoughts and feelings.\r\n\r\nThe book has
      plenty of personal photographs, accounts of Aajoba's hobbies, pictures of cards
      written to the writer in his handwriting, pictures of the bags he made from
      re-cycled clothes and so much more that gives us a comprehensive picture of
      the person he was in Taruja's memories.\r\n\r\nAll the more wonderful from a
      child's point-of-view, as these are simple, everyday pleasures that mean more
      to a child than all the big things in the world, the little things that go into
      weaving a tapestry of memories. "

    - This is the first I Can Read Book ever, and the first of five classic Little
      Bear books, expressly designed for beginning readers. Elsa Holmelund Minarik
      and Maurice Sendak teamed up to create these simple stories that are deeply
      comforting and lovingly playful. In one story, "Birthday Soup," Little Bear
      cannot find his mother and presumes she has forgotten his birthday. With the
      prospect of guests arriving and no cake in sight, he sets out to make birthday
      soup (all his friends like soup). Just as the gathering is sitting down for
      soup, Mother Bear shows up with a big, beautiful birthday cake. "I never did
      forget your birthday, and I never will," she says to her son as he hugs her
      leg. In "Little Bear Goes to the Moon," Little Bear declares that he will fly
      to the moon in his new space helmet. Mother Bear tells him to be back by lunch,
      and he is. The gentle, teasing repartee between Little Bear and his mother will
      delight young readers, and the spacious layout and large type will encourage
      them to keep on reading! (

      story strikes a universal chord by highlighting the empathetic relationship
      people share with nature when their everyday lives are so closely linked with
      it. Clear lines and earthy colours of the folkstyle illustrations capture the
      grand sweep of the river and life beside it.

    - Martin Handford is the creator of the hugely popular Where's Wally? series.
      Beginning in 1987, the books have become a multi-million-selling global success.
      Martin Handford spent much of his childhood drawing and his earliest influences
      were cinema epics and playing with toy soldiers. At art college he continued
      to draw what he calls "busy and militarily correct battle scenes" which led
      to his job as a freelance illustrator specialising in drawing crowd scenes for
      numerous clients. Martin now gathers his inspiration from a huge variety of
      sources; films, visiting museums and art galleries, reading comics and books,
      and collecting ephemera and trivia. He is fascinated by crowds, and is attracted
      to their vibes, patterns and details especially humour. "I love their movement
      and energy." He is also constantly on the look-out for puns and wordplay that
      can be used in his pictures. Gradually, from all this meticulous research, the
      inspiration for a picture emerges, which Martin embellishes with his own ideas
      to create astonishing scenes. Each picture takes Martin months to draw. "As
      I work my way through a picture, I add Wally when I come to what I feel is a
      good place to hide him," he explains.

    - ! "When Dr. Seuss gets serious, you know it must be important. Published in
      1971, and perhaps inspired by the \"save our planet\" mindset of the 1960s,
      The Lorax is an ecological warning that still rings true today amidst the dangers
      of clear-cutting, pollution, and disregard for the earth's environment. In The
      Lorax, we find what we've come to expect from the illustrious doctor: brilliantly
      whimsical rhymes, delightfully original creatures, and weirdly undulating illustrations.
      But here there is also something more--a powerful message that Seuss implores
      both adults and children to heed.\r\n\r\nThe now remorseful Once-ler--our faceless,
      bodiless narrator--tells the story himself. Long ago this enterprising villain
      chances upon a place filled with wondrous Truffula Trees, Swomee-Swans, Brown
      Bar-ba- loots, and Humming-Fishes. Bewitched by the beauty of the Truffula Tree
      tufts, he greedily chops them down to produce and mass-market Thneeds. (\"It's
      a shirt. It's a sock. It's a glove. It's a hat.\") As the trees swiftly disappear
      and the denizens leave for greener pastures, the fuzzy yellow Lorax (who speaks
      for the trees \"for the trees have no tongues\") repeatedly warns the Once-ler,
      but his words of wisdom are for naught. Finally the Lorax extricates himself
      from the scorched earth (by the seat of his own furry pants), leaving only a
      rock engraved \"UNLESS.\" Thus, with his own colorful version of a compelling
      morality play, Dr. Seuss teaches readers not to fool with Mother Nature. But
      as you might expect from Seuss, all hope is not lost--the Once-ler has saved
      a single Truffula Tree seed! Our fate now rests in the hands of a caring child,
      who becomes our last chance for a clean, green future. "

      as used in mathematical calculations. The story is a fictional take on actual
      research done on the subject. A merchant living in Takshashila (north-western
      India) finds he has to do calculations all the time. But without ‘zero’, it
      is a complicated process indeed. One night, he falls asleep on his papers. When
      he wakes up, sunlight is streaming in through the latticed window, throwing
      circular beams of light on his calculations. An idea is sparked off. Eureka!\r\n
      The people of the time – trade, trade routes, architecture, dress styles, dyes
      used, and so on – were also researched for authenticity in the film, which carries
      into the illustrations. The earthy colours and textures provide a vivid complement
      to the text. Bhojpatra (birchbark), used for manuscripts those days, has been
      used as a backdrop for an old-world feel."

    - ! "Mystic weaver, radical reformer, loved and hated equally in his time . .
      . the simple wisdom of his pithy couplets, the famous dohas, makes him one of
      the most frequently quoted poets even today. Yet Kabir the person remains an
      enigma.\r\n     This brilliant novel traces one day in Kabir’s life, from Daybreak
      through Midday to Nightfall. Threading fact, legend and poetry into a superbly
      structured narrative, it etches Kabir’s compelling persona against the backdrop
      of fifteenth century Banaras — a period that mirrors quite remarkably our own
      troubled times. Spare visuals before each section continue Kabir’s own favourite
      metaphor of weaving, a delicate tapestry of the city unravelling as the day
      progresses. Kabir the Weaver-Poet is a landmark in contemporary writing for
      young readers and old — thrilling yet gently emotive, incredibly blending high
      drama with the mesmerising calm of Kabir’s beliefs."

      and unhappy. Even if Dunham Girls’ School is supposed to be the best in Asia.
      Even if, as her father had promised, it has a fabulous library. But the library
      soon becomes her haven, losing herself in books a shield against her deepening
      homesickness. Then one day she hears that the writer Ruskin Bond, whose books
      she devours, stays less than an hour away. Could it be true that the famous
      author is a real, living person, breathing the same Uttarakhand air as herself?
      Could she, Advaita, also become a writer? Advaita emerges out of her cocoon
      into a world fresh with ideas and inspiring possibilities.\r\n\r\nUnfolding
      gently and sensitively with the pace of Advaita’s changing emotions, this is
      a story about the love of books, the power of the imagination, of literary heroes,
      and of the birth of dreams."

    - ! "THERE is something irresistible about the book, Advaita the Writer, by Ken
      Spillman. It's not just the story, the characters, the setting, the language
      or the structure. It's something else, something less conspicuous, like the
      roots of a tree buried deep inside. Sometimes it's the turn of a phrase, sometimes
      it's the shape and contours of Advaita's mind, sometimes it is the clash of
      the adult world and the adolescent world, but always it is there. That something
      which makes you want to reread and relive the story, breathing in Spillman's
      sheer genius.\r\n\r\nAdvaita the Writer is many stories rolled into one. It
      is the story of separation, of belonging, of space, of identity, of dreams,
      of inspiration, each an intrinsic aspect of growing up. Right from page one,
      we are pulled into Advaita’s unique world, as she readies herself to leave for
      the Dunham Girls' School in Dehradun, venturing from the familiar to the unknown.
      Her first experiences at school, her loneliness and fear, her yearning for home,
      her inevitable withdrawal into the world of books and ideas, and the natural
      evolution of her thoughts revealed in her letters, makes every single nuance
      of her character real and tangible. So when she discovers that her favourite
      author, Ruskin Bond, lives in Dehradun, breathing the same air as she does,
      the disbelief she feels is palpable, as is the awe she goes through when she
      actually meets him. And when she is finally at peace with her situation, you
      feel calmer too, finding comfort in the sanguinity of life that Advaita discovers
      in the end.\r\nWhat keeps this delightfully unpredictable world of Advaita aloft
      is Spillman’s narrative. It flows like a happy river, meandering through difficult
      emotions and exciting metaphors with equal ease, as it runs its preordained
      course.\r\nThroughout the book, Spillman gently pushes the boundaries of language,
      never once compromising on the intelligence of the reader or taking it for granted.
      It’s a delicate balance that is rarely achieved in books for young readers.\r\nThe
      illustrations by Menon too are spot on, hovering, almost respectfully, behind
      Advaita’s story.\r\nRead this book to be touched by not just the magic of Ruskin
      Bond, but also that of Spillman’s through lovely, whimsical Advaita. -  Praveena

      away. He hops onto a train going to Chennai. From there he smuggles himself
      onto a boat going to . . . the Andaman islands! Rich with adventure and humour,
      full of the wonders of nature, the book is also filled with details about the
      unique, misunderstood world of the Jarawa, a tribe in the Andamans whose very
      survival is being threatened, especially by the forces of so-called development.
      Nature drawings by Indraneil Das are beautifully offset by soft pencil sketches

      action-packed story about Arif, a courageous little orphan boy who comes under
      the guardianship of a nasty and mercenary uncle and aunt after his wealthy parents
      pass away in a car accident. Unable to bear their oppression anymore Arif leaves
      home in the dead of night and finds his way to Dadar Railway Station in Central
      Mumbai from where he boards a train to Chennai. His luck betrays him as he is
      identified at Chennai station because of a ‘Missing’ poster, but ingenuity and
      grit guide him as he disguises himself variously with a shaven head, a ‘lungi’
      in place of a pant, a limp, a striped religious mark on his forehead, a change
      of name from Arif to Ram and an ‘Om Ganesaya Namaha’ chant. He finally reaches
      Wandoor Island in the Andamans where he tends crocodiles for a living.\r\n\r\nSince
      Arif’s inheritance is estimated to be immense his relatives are not going to
      give up on him easily and he learns that he is being pursued even in the Andaman
      Islands. He now joins Aung Thwin, a Myanmarese fisherman who is fleeing Andaman
      Islands for his homeland in a boat. Arif disembarks on a boot-shaped island
      where for a while he lives alone and explores nature. Here he has an incidental
      encounter with Eetha Aleho, a young Jarawa boy and through him gets accepted
      in the Jarawa fold and becomes an Andamans Boy. It is here that one gets an
      insight into Jarawa traditions, customs, food habits and integrity. Their deep
      knowledge and respect for the environment and wise usage of its resources force
      the reader to re-think about the concepts of ‘civilization’ and ‘development’,
      while serving many a valuable lesson about natural history.\r\n\r\nAs an alien
      who has been admitted into the Jarawa clan, Arif has a dual language advantage
      and is able to interpret the demonic plans of certain government officials who
      arrive in ‘gift boats’ and entice the Jarawa with trifle presents such as buckets
      and red cloth in an attempt to displace them from their natural habitat. As
      one such ‘benevolent crook’ remarks, “The government is going to make 100 crores
      from these forests … Don’t you think that’s more important than 300 junglees…?”
      Arif alerts his clan who repel the next ‘gift invasion’ and subsequently with
      the intercession of the country’s Prime Minister it is resolved to put an end
      to the Jarawa gift dropping story, encroachments and interference. Arif is the
      hero of the hour as the novella ends on a positive and optimistic note.- Dr

      in this humorous creation. This handbook dramatically states, "A fear faced
      is a fear defeated," and encourages the fainthearted to conquer their fright
      through writing, drawing, and collage. Spare text and delightful illustrations
      chronicle this nervous rodent's journey. From ablutophobia, the fear of bathing,
      to sciaphobia, the fear of shadows, the striking mixed-media art captures the
      humorous adventures of the white mouse and his red pencil. The pictures emphasize
      shadow and light, pitting the winsome rodent against some of the scariest and
      most exotic phobias. Unusual elements abound through a hodgepodge of folded
      maps and newspaper clippings; varied perspectives and dominant figures feature
      a cameo by the Three Blind Mice and a dramatic retelling of "Hickory Dickory
      Dock." With nuanced facial expressions, the mouse scurries through each textured
      spread against warm cream-colored backgrounds; his actualization reveals a delightful
      conclusion. Through one-on-one sharing or personal perusal, readers will clamor
      to relive this small hero's adventures.—Meg Smith

      examines two fears, giving the Latin name, definition, and icon in the upper

      who suffers from musophobia (fear of mice) standing on a chair: I’m afraid of

      me! Some of the clever addenda may pass younger readers by, but adults and older

    - Picking right up where Charlie and the Chocolate Factory left off, Charlie and
      the Great Glass Elevator continues the adventures of Charlie Bucket, his family,
      and Willy Wonka, the eccentric candy maker. As the book begins, our heroes are
      shooting into the sky in a glass elevator, headed for destinations unknown.
      What follows is exactly the kind of high-spirited magical madness and mayhem
      we've all come to expect from Willy Wonka and his creator Roald Dahl. The American
      space race gets a send-up, as does the President, and Charlie's family gets
      a second chance at childhood. Throw in the Vermicious Knids, Gnoolies, and Minusland
      and we once again witness pure genius.

    - Once again the little bear of Else Minarik and Maurice Sendak (illustrator)
      proves himself to be as wistful and tender a little creature as exists in the
      child's library. In this episode, little bear makes friends with a child named
      Emily. With their friends, a duck, a cat, an owl, and a hen, they play all through
      the happy summer. Even when Emily's doll breaks an arm the pleasure the group
      finds in each other's company is not diminished. Only the departure of Emily
      brings tears to Little Bear who is consoled by his mother with his thought that,
      at least, he can write to her. Pathetic fallacies abound here, but somehow in
      the hands of this author-illustrator team, they merely compound the charm of
      the story.

    - By the time it came to the edge of the Forest the stream had grown up, so that
      it was almost a river, and, being grown-up, it did not run and jump and sparkle
      along as it used to do when it was younger, but moved more slowly. For it knew
      now where it was going, and it said to itself, ‘There is no hurry. We shall
      get there some day.’ But all the little streams higher up in the Forest went
      this way and that, quickly, eagerly, having so much to find out before it was
      too late.

    - Kindergarten-Grade 4-- Mirette's mother keeps a boardinghouse that attracts
      traveling performers . The girl is intrigued by one silent visitor, Bellini,
      who has come for a rest. She finds him next morning walking a high wire strung
      across the backyard. Immediately, she is drawn to it, practicing on it herself
      until she finds her balance and can walk its distance. But she finds the man
      unusually secretive about his identity; he was a famous high-wire artist, but
      has lost his courage. He is lured by an agent to make a comeback, but freezes
      on the wire. Seeing Mirette at the end of it restores his nerve; after the performance
      the two set off on a new career together. As improbable as the story is, its
      theatrical setting at some historical distance, replete with European architecture
      and exotic settings and people, helps lend credibility to this circus tale.
      Mirette, through determination and perhaps talent, trains herself, overcoming
      countless falls on cobblestone, vaunting pride that goes before a fall, and
      lack of encouragement from Bellini. The impressionistic paintings, full of mottled,
      rough edges and bright colors, capture both the detail and the general milieu
      of Paris in the last century. The colors are reminiscent of Toulouse-Lautrec,
      the daubing technique of Seurat. A satisfying, high-spirited adventure. --Ruth

      On Tuesday, she knocks a plant off the windowsill. "There was water everywhere!"
      And so Cookie undergoes a week of disasters that dePaola illustrates with his
      usual skill, so that even the garbage Cookie strews over the floor looks great.
      Four scrapes later, the text ends with "Tomorrow is Sunday. Maybe Cookie will
      rest." But Cookie, half-asleep on the rug, already has one eye on a bumblebee.
      This is a perfect choice for very young children, and extra-large print makes
      it even more accessible. Part of the fun of the illustrations is what is barely
      glimpsed: a tail extending from behind a curtain, very wet haunches exiting
      the bathroom or the same tail drifting over muddy footprints through the flower
      pots. Cookie appears in only three full-body shots throughout the book; the
      rest of the time she is almost out of the frame of her most recent disaster.

    - Gr. 1-3. When Henry's cousin Annie comes for a visit, she's timid around his
      big dog Mudge, shocked by his messy room, and disgusted by his smelly fish tank.
      She's not a bad sort, though, and just as she tries to get used to Henry's ways,
      he tries to see her point of view, "even though Henry could not believe a person
      would not like dog kisses." By the next day, Annie's loosened up and looking
      forward to another visit with cousin Henry and the ever-drooling Mudge. Simple
      and funny, this beginning reader has plenty of appeal. Stevenson's line-and-watercolor
      illustrations seem slapdash and informal yet manage to catch the right facial
      expression and body language time and time again.

      a great change ... and a great sacrifice.

      Here, a little girl is the patient hostess to a demanding piglet, whose myriad
      requests lead them from the kitchen table to the bathtub to the backyard. Along
      the way, the endearing porker puts on a pair of tap shoes, gets her picture
      taken balancing on top of the living room furniture, prepares a stack of mail
      to send to her friends, and builds and decorates a tree house. Preschoolers
      and beginning readers will enjoy spotting the objects mentioned in the story.
      Beginning with the cover illustration of the piglet daintily perched on a windowsill,
      Bond has once again created an adorable character that expresses the text perfectly.
      The humor and quick pace of Numeroff's engaging narrative make this book an
      excellent choice for reading aloud. A surefire crowd-pleaser.

      clad in bright plaid shirts and lederhosen, leave their snug cottage, intent
      upon finding the perfect gifts for their mother. Their early morning search
      is filled with dangers: a snake hidden in the thick underbush, a fox running
      by. However, the mice are brave, and hand-in-tail, they traipse through brush
      and briars to find their presents. In the end, it is Little Mouse, returning
      empty-handed, who has the best surprise of all: a song. The perspective is from
      a mouse''s vantage point: toadstools and ferns seem like trees; a ripe, juicy
      strawberry is so big that Middle Mouse can barely carry his gift in his two
      arms; a dandelion fluff ball towers over Biggest Mouse. Through deft, simple
      lines, Brett captures the brothers'' fear, their enjoyment of the sights, smells
      and sounds of their world and finally, their sheer delight at finding just the
      right gifts for their appreciative mother. The finely honed details, the soft
      colors, the expressions of love and sharing make this a story that is as fresh

      boys might be happily surprised if they take another peek at their sisters'
      shelves. Little House in the Big Woods--the first book of the series and Laura
      Ingalls Wilder's first children's book--is full of the thrills, chills, and
      spills typically associated with \"boy\" books. Any boy or girl who has fantasized
      about running off to live in the woods will find ample information in these
      pages to manage a Wisconsin snowstorm, a panther attack, or a wild sled ride
      with a pig as an uninvited guest. Every chapter divulges fascinatingly intricate,
      yet easy-to-read, details about pioneer life in the Midwest in the late 1800s,
      from bear-meat curing to maple-tree sapping to homemade bullet making.\r\n\r\nWilder's
      autobiographical tales ring with truth and excitement. Readers will receive
      a perfectly painless history lesson, and in fact will clamor for more. Beloved
      illustrator Garth Williams spent years researching young Laura's pioneering
      family. His soft-line illustrations bring to life the full, simple days and
      nights in the family's log cabin. No one can read just one Little House book!

    - From cover to moral (never swallow a horse), this cleverly illustrated version
      of an old folk favorite will delight children. Each page is full of details
      and humorous asides, from the names of different types of birds, to a recipe
      for spider soup, to the rhyming asides from the spectating animals. As for the
      old lady, with her toothy grin and round bloodshot eyes, she looks wacky enough
      to go so far as to swallow a horse. A die-cut hole allows readers to see inside
      her belly, first the critters already devoured and, with the turn of the page,
      the new animal that will join the crowd in her ever-expanding stomach. The pattern
      of the lady's dress, with its patchwork of bright, torn colored paper pasted
      on black, is used as the background motif for the words. The text is handwritten
      on vivid strips of paper that are loosely placed on the patterned page, thus
      creating a lively interplay between the meaning of the words and their visual
      power. All in all, this illustrator provides an eye-catching, energy-filled
      interpretation that could easily become a classic in itself.

    - ! 'A die-cut hole approach to an old favorite that offers a view of the old
      lady''s stomach and its expanding bestiary. The text has the look of a ransom
      note (a touch the devoured creatures might appreciate), but the jaunty colors--set
      skipping by a judicious use of black--keep the dark side of the poem at bay.
      Those accustomed to the streamlined version of this ditty won''t know what to
      make of the comments scattered throughout the pages, little asides quipped by
      animals not yet swallowed; these rhyme with the ``perhaps she''ll die'''' line
      of the poem. Fortunately, these additions can be easily ignored or inflated
      according to taste, and full concentration given to the poem itself and the
      wild, eye-catching artwork: It is good fun to watch the old lady bulge and bloat,
      and the sheer corniness of the verse continues to be deeply gratifying. '

      mischief and gets sent to bed without supper. Fortuitously, a forest grows in
      his room, allowing his wild rampage to continue unimpaired. Sendak's color illustrations
      (perhaps his finest) are beautiful, and each turn of the page brings the discovery
      of a new wonder.\r\n\r\nThe wild things--with their mismatched parts and giant
      eyes--manage somehow to be scary-looking without ever really being scary; at

      tale, which floats between the land of dreams and a child's imagination.\r\n"

    - ! "There isn't a creature in the world Stanley doesn't adore. Pigeons, snakes,
      penguins, worms, elephants, you name it. But the animals Stanley goes really
      mad over are... SHARKS! Even though he's never met one, he knows a lot about
      them from his good friend, Dennis, who also happens to be Stanley's pet goldfish.
      In many ways, goldfish are a lot like sharks. They both have fins and gills,
      eat their meals underwater--why, they're even related! (\"Though they are distant
      relatives and rarely keep in touch.\") Stanley figures if he can look after
      a goldfish, he can probably look after a shark. Or can he?\r\nGriff (a.k.a.
      Andrew Griffin) has created a delightfully humorous story, with plenty of honest-to-goodness
      shark facts painlessly thrown in for good measure. Big-headed, sparsely coifed
      Stanley and his glum pal Dennis (you'd be glum too, if you were going to have
      to share your home with a massive cannibalistic relative) are a terrifically
      appealing pair. Griff's clever computer-generated illustrations are full of
      verve and personality, with witty, often subtle details. The small print on
      the shark food packaging reads: \"No artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives.
      People may accidentally be included in this product. Store in a damp environment.
      Not suitable for vegetarians.\" This picture book, however, is suitable for
      vegetarians, carnivores, and any other dry-land critters. A simple, interactive
      CD-ROM is included, with games, facts, screen saver, and much more. --Emilie

    - ! 'Striking an uneasy balance of jokes and science, this quirky volume introduces
      Stanley, a large-headed cartoon character who loves critters of all kindsD"He
      even loves SHARKS!" Noting that the boy "learns a lot" about sharks from Dennis,
      his pet goldfish, British author Griff interjects some cursory information on
      the physical features, behavior and varieties of sharks on bulletin board-like
      spreads, while additional spreads feature stylized artwork with nonsensical
      fantasies of what it would entail for Stanley to have a shark as a pet. The
      boy compares the needs of sharks to those of goldfish: one illustration shows
      Stanley taking Dennis on the bus in a water-filled baggie; the next shows a
      crane lifting a shark to transport it home. An accompanying CD-ROM, tucked into
      the front cover, offers a screen saver featuring Dennis swimming around in his
      bowl (but, curiously, no shark), a pair of passable interactive games and facts
      about sharks that duplicate the text of the book. The disc, too, comes up short:
      its gateway imageDa silhouette of Stanley''s houseDgives kids the option of
      entering only one of the four rooms; a click on the other spaces brings up the
      statement that these will be "available with future titles." Given the package''s
      disappointments, readers may not stick around to sample subsequent releases
      featuring Stanley. Though Griff infuses his pictures and text with doses of
      humor, he includes too little substance and too much filler to satisfy children
      interested in learning about sharks.'

    - ! "John Steptoe was born in Brooklyn. From early childhood, he drew pictures
      and told stories with them. He started work on Stevie, his first picture book,
      when he was sixteen, and Stevie was published three years later to outstanding
      critical acclaim. Since then, he has written and illustrated many successful
      books for children.\r\n\r\nJohn Lewis Steptoe, creator of award-winning picture
      books for children, was born in Brooklyn on September 14, 1950 and was raised
      in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of that borough. He began drawing as a young
      child and received his formal art training at the High School of Art and Design
      in Manhattan. He was a student in the HARYOU-ACT Art Program and instructed
      by the highly recognized African American oil painter, Norman Lewis. He also
      studied at the Vermont Academy, where he was instructed by the sculptor, John
      Torres, and William Majors, a painter acclaimed by the Museum of Modem Art for
      his etchings and print-making.\r\n\r\nHis work first came to national attention
      in 1969 when his first book, Stevie, appeared in its entirety in Life magazine,
      hailed as \"a new kind of book for black children.\" Mr. Steptoe, who had begun
      work on Stevie at the age of 16, was then 18 years old.\r\n\r\nIn his 20-year
      career, Mr. Steptoe illustrated 15 more picture books, ten of which he also
      wrote. The American Library Association named two of his books Caldecott Honor
      Books, a prestigious award for children's book illustration: The Story of Jumping
      Mouse in 1985 and Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters in 1988. Mr. Steptoe twice received
      the Coretta Scott King Award for Illustration, for Mother Crocodile (text by
      Rosa Guy) in 1982, and for Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters.\r\n\r\nWhile all of
      Mr. Steptoe's work deals with aspects of the African American experience, Mufaro's
      Beautiful Daughters was acknowledged by reviewers and critics as a breakthrough.
      Based on an African tale recorded in the 19th century, it required Mr. Steptoe
      for the first time to research African history and culture, awakening his pride
      in his African ancestry. Mr. Steptoe hoped that his books would lead children,
      especially African American children, to feel pride in their origins and in
      who they are. \"I am not an exception to the rule among my race of people,\"
      he said, accepting the Boston Globe/Horn Book Award for Illustration, \"I am
      the rule. By that I mean there are a great many others like me where I come
      from.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Steptoe frequently spoke to audiences of children and adults
      about his work. He was the 1989 winner of the Milner Award, voted by Atlanta
      schoolchildren for their favorite author.\r\n\r\nJohn Steptoe died on August
      28, 1989 at Saint Luke's Hospital in Manhattan, following a long illness. He
      was 38 years old and lived in Brooklyn. Mr. Steptoe was among the small handful
      of African American artists who have made a career in children's books."

    - A storm is approaching and Big Gander Goose and Little Goosey need somewhere
      to hide. Each place they find is already occupied by another animal and though
      they are asked in, Little Goosey whispers, "I don't want anybody else when the
      thunder comes. Just me and you." With quiet understanding, the adult goose declines
      each invitation and the two birds eventually nestle together under a bush. What
      is most important in this repetitive story is the connection between Big Gander
      Goose and Little Goosey. It speaks to a small child's desire for exclusiveness
      with a parent or caregiver. The watercolor and colored-pencil illustrations
      support this connection, often showing Little Goosey peeking from behind the
      gander or snuggled up to his breast or against his outstretched wing. A comforting
      story to share at bedtime.

      ice and snow, cold feet, and nothing but bark to eat, but his mother lovingly

      very little in the way of plot, but features a wealth of large, misty watercolors
      in lucious pastel shades that are as soft and cuddly as a child's favorite blanket.
      Hopper conveys the same all-encompassing sense of security and warmth as does

      way back home. Together they follow the train tracks, turn into the forest,
      follow the sun and even get through a blizzard! In this endearing tale of friendship
      and companionship, the two little ones are guided by an owl and a llama, until
      at last they find mama and papa tiger. -Manasi Karthik

    - Attacked by an owl, Stellaluna (a fruit bat) is separated from her mother and
      taken in by a bird and her nestlings. Dutifully, she tries to accommodate--she
      eats insects, hangs head up, and sleeps at night, as Mama Bird says she must--but
      once Stellaluna learns to fly, it's a huge relief when her own mother finds
      her and explains that the behavior that comes naturally is appropriate to her
      species. With a warm, nicely honed narration, Cannon strikes just the right
      balance between accurate portrayal of the bats and the fantasy that dramatizes
      their characteristics. Her illustrations, in luminous acrylics and color pencils,
      are exquisite. The appealingly furry, wide-eyed, fawn-colored bats have both
      scientific precision and real character; they're displayed against intense skies
      or the soft browns and greens of the woodland in spare, beautifully constructed
      (occasionally even humorous) compositions. Delightful and informative but never
      didactic; a splendid debut.

      named Sal who--try as she might--just can't seem to pick as fast as she eats.

      to mention appetite--of youth. Sal and her mother set off in search of blueberries
      for the winter at the same time as a mother bear and her cub. A quiet comedy
      of errors ensues when the young ones wander off and absentmindedly trail the

      tikki tembo (which means "the most wonderful thing in the whole wide world")
      and his brother Chang (which means "little or nothing") get into trouble with
      a well, are saved by the Old Man with the Ladder, and change history while they''re

    - Elephants are gray. Pigs are pink. Only the chameleon has no color of his own.
      He is purple like the heather, yellow like a lemon, even black and orange striped
      like a tiger! Then one day a chameleon has an idea to remain one color forever
      by staying on the greenest leaf he can find. But in the autumn, the leaf changes
      from green to yellow to red . . . and so does the chameleon. When another chameleon
      suggests they travel together, he learns that companionship is more important
      than having a color of his own. No matter where he goes with his new friend,
      they will always be alike.

    - Donning a fairy costume inspires a little girl's imagination in this droll picture
      book. Alice speaks for herself, claiming she can fly (not too high but really
      fast), can change her dad into a horse (for a horsey ride), can make herself
      disappear (by flicking off the light switch with her wand), and can turn oatmeal
      into cake by pouring on fairy dust (sugar). There are elements of danger, such
      as broccoli poisoned by the wicked Duchess (Mom) and baths (fairies hate baths),
      as well as mischief ("…my mom made cookies for my dad. So I turned them into
      mine") and mishaps ("Once I accidentally turned my white dress into a red one").
      Alice knows that Permanent fairyhood requires a lot of tests, attending Advanced
      Fairy School, and learning how to "make clothes get up off the floor and… line
      up in the closet," so she'll "probably be a Temporary fairy forever." With his
      signature cartoon-style art and childlike lettering, Shannon has created a winsome,
      exuberant heroine whose wide eyes and toothy smile bring David to mind, though
      Alice's blond ringlets are all her own. Variety in page and text layout and
      the use of brilliant color make the pictures dance and occasionally pop right
      off the pages. An enjoyable romp.

      poem. Marzollo, the author of the I Spy series, summons the sun to shine down
      on a host of living things: "Sun, light the woods/ With a soft spring dawn;/
      Shine on the spots/ Of a newborn fawn." After the sun awakens a sleeping boy
      and his puppy, the latter is seen investigating blooming flowers and vegetables
      from the garden, all nourished by the sun. A new order is issued at sunset ("Sun,
      be wild./ Sun, be bold./ Paint skies pink/ And purple and gold"), whereupon
      the sky darkens and the pup and child curl up in bed until "a brand-new dawn"
      arrives. The gentle rhythm and sing-song quality make this verse a good bedtime
      book for beginning readers. Regan''s (Welcome to the Green House) art features
      a soothing, pastel-dominated palette-and introduces a downright adorable puppy.

      in watercolors and colored pencils show plenty of action and accurately reflect
      the concise text that explains the many ways to say "hello" and "goodbye." While
      entertaining readers, the author offers vocabulary by providing synonyms, and
      then explains that sometimes words are not necessary if gestures are used. Illustrations
      of people from far-away lands in traditional dress are found throughout. This
      engaging picture book makes a good read-aloud, but it is a better choice to
      sit and read one-on-one in order to mine all the gold nuggets to be found on

      have many meanings. "Hello" is an introduction, a welcome, a spectacular welcome.
      It can be said in different ways ("good-morning," "howdy" ). It can even be
      said without words (a wave or the shake of a hand.) It can be loud or soft or
      take on many moods. The same is true of "good-bye," although that is often more
      difficult to say than "hello." Using her signature artwork, appealing in its

      all the many moods of greetings.

      child to enter the deep dark woods and ends with that child achieving incredible
      success without ever setting a toe in the forbidden forest. But not this book.
      Here, Billy's mom issues a few scary warnings about the woods to her son--\"Beware!
      Beware! The Forest of Sin! None come out, but many go in!\"--turns her back
      for a second, and the next thing you know the devil shows up and whispers something
      to Bobby about wild strawberries. Blammo! Guess where Billy goes--straight to
      the forbidden forest, of course. At this point, if you are reading the story
      aloud to your child, you may think there's a parable on the way. But just when
      you might expect to run into monsters named Lust, Avarice, and Three-Toed Sloth
      (okay, maybe not Lust), a real monster comes careening along and you realize
      that this story is just a fairy tale after all--and quite a lovely one at that.\r\nThe
      Minpins taps into the powerful, wonderful child's fantasy of discovering a hidden
      civilization of tiny folk that accepts and honors him or her. The very best
      part of this fairy tale is the denouement, where Billy receives the gift of
      nightly escape on the wings of a swan. One of Roald Dahl's only picture books--with
      fabulously crosshatched pen-and-ink illustrations by Patrick Benson--The Minpins
      is superb for reading aloud to the three- to eight-year-old set. And it culminates
      in a sentence or two of advice that your children just might remember for the
      rest of their lives."

    - ! "There's a streak of the weird in Mr. Silverstein's fun. It turns up in a
      poem called \"Who Ordered the Broiled Face?\" and in another, \"Quick Trip\"
      in which a couple of kids are swallowed by a colossal lizard, then immediately
      excreted to safety. Characteristic of Mr. Silverstein, too, is a vague and dreamy
      religiosity (\"God says to me with a kind of smile,/'Hey how would you like
      to be God awhile?'\"). In some of his most memorable nonsense, Mr. Silverstein
      is playfully disruptive of parental authority. The natural joy that children
      take in testing their tethers to breaking point (for they don't, of course,
      want the tethers to snap) will be kindled and sustained in Mr. Silverstein's
      rhymes about Little Abigail, who dies because her parents won't buy her a pony.
      And about Clarence, who sends away for a new mail-order set of folks.\r\nA Silverstein
      poetry book looks worth the money, as if it will last a child awhile; and, in
      fact, it gives excellent value. Both cartoons and verses in this new bunch seem
      just about as lively as those in \"Sidewalk.\""

    - ! 'A nameless little boy braves the first day of school in this crisply illustrated
      picture book. The text is a series of idioms that take him through the day,
      from waking up "on the wrong side of the bed," to having a "long face" at lunch,
      to being "happy as a puppy with two tails" when he finally comes home to his
      dog. The illustrations interpret each idiom literally, often to comic effect:
      "we''d be in a real pickle if we missed the bus" is accompanied by a pickle-as-bus
      picture, while meeting the "Big Cheese" shows a principal wearing a dress made
      of Swiss cheese. Bloch''s graphic style incorporates photographs of objects
      into pen-and-ink drawings, and the copious use of white space keeps the focus
      squarely on the words and their visual interpretations. Here, Bloch''s simple
      though imaginative pictures and clean visual style invite discussion of the
      deeper meanings of these oft-used phrases, making this an ideal book for the
      classroom or for one-on-one sharing.—Kathleen Kelly MacMillan'

    - ! 'Taking metaphors literally is always fun, especially for young kids, for
      whom the images are fresh. Bloch’s clear pen-and-ink drawings with occasional
      photographic collage do a great job of juxtaposing fact and feeling in the wry
      scenarios that illustrate the literal meaning of common sayings. In one scene,
      for example, a young boy has ants in his pants and is laughing his head off,
      even as the teacher tells him to zip his lip. Whether beginning preschool for
      the first time or returning to grade school after vacation, readers will recognize
      the panic and the fantasy of being top banana, the joy of throwing the baby
      out with the bathwater, the need to bottle up your feelings, and the nurse who
      keeps an eye out. The slapstick fun with words and pictures will appeal to preschoolers,
      but it is older grade-schoolers who will enjoy exploring the ways that words
      work. '

    - About the Author
    - ! "\"And now, children, your Uncle Shelby is going to tell you a story about
      a very strange lion- in fact, the strangest lion I have ever met.\" So begins
      Shel Silverstein's very first children's book, Lafcadio, the Lion Who Shot Back.
      It's funny and sad and has made readers laugh and think since it was published
      in 1963. It was followed the next year by three more books. \r\nThe first of
      them, The Giving Tree, is a moving story about the love of a tree for a boy.
      \r\nShel returned to humor the same year with A Giraffe and a Half, delighting
      readers with a most riotous ending. The third book in 1964 was Uncle Shelby's
      Zoo Don't Bump the Glump! and Other Fantasies, Shel's first poetry collection,
      and his first and only book illustrated in full color. It combined his unique
      imagination and bold brand of humor in this collection of silly and scary creatures.
      \r\nShel's second collection of poems and drawings, Where the Sidewalk Ends,
      was published in 1974. His recording of the poems won him a Grammy for best
      Children's Album. In this collection, Shel invited children to dream and dare
      to imagine the impossible, from a hippopotamus sandwich to the longest nose
      in the world. With his next collection of poems and drawings, A Light in the
      Attic, published in 1981, Shel asked his readers to turn the light on in their
      attics, to put something silly in the world, and not to be discouraged by the
      Whatifs. Instead he urged readers to catch the moon or invite a dinosaur to
      dinner- to have fun! \r\nA Light in the Attic was the first children's book
      to break onto the New York Times Bestseller List, where it stayed for a record-breaking
      182 weeks. \r\nThe last book that was published before his death in 1999 was
      Falling Up (1996). Like his other books, it is filled with unforgettable characters.
      Shel Silverstein's legacy continued with the release of a new work,Runny Babbit,
      the first posthumous publication conceived and completed before his death and
      released in March 2005. Witty and wondrous, Runny Babbit is a poetry collection
      of simple spoonerisms, which twist the tongue and tease the mind.Shel was always
      a believer in letting his work do the talking for him--few authors have ever
      done it better.\r\n"

      her first day at a new school, she looks very grown-up indeed. So grown-up,
      in fact, that when she arrives at the school, she is mistaken for a new teacher,
      and left in charge of a classroom of kids! Jenny's first instinct is to escape,
      but on her way out she gets caught by Miss Ice, the strict school principal,
      who is not very impressed to find a new teacher sneaking around the corridors.
      Petrified by the terrifying Miss Ice, Jenny is forced to keep up the act, and
      soon finds herself in all sorts of tricky situations, culminating in a rather
      explosive chemistry lesson. How long will it be before Jenny is found out? Will
      she and her pupils survive the day? Whatever happens, it's going to be a real

      path of finding the five aunts whom she has never known. This seems like the
      perfect start of a juicy family mystery but it never quite turns into one. When
      given the full story of her father''s loss of his five older sisters and a clue
      to the whereabouts of one of them, Harriet embarks on a hasty journey of collection.
      Useful coincidences make the women ridiculously easy to locate; it also helps
      that the final two are mind readers and come seeking her. The real mystery is
      how the father can possibly be absentminded enough to misplace five sisters.
      All of them are likable characters with interesting personality quirks and gadgets:
      strong-woman Veronica uses pedal power to drive her circus trailer from city
      to city, and twin detectives Thessalonika and Japonica are masters of disguise
      with convincing costumes. It is these two who give Harriet the chance to solve
      a mystery in the sequel, which takes place at a racetrack''s stables. Masquerading
      as a jockey, Harriet is confronted with a villain who uses glue to stick a horse''s
      feet to the floor so that he won''t run well the next day. It''s contrived stuff
      such as this that takes most of the charm out of this easy chapter-book series.'

    - Dahl's latest piece of madcap mayhem is a story filled with the elements that
      his fans cravesardonic humor, the evilest of villians, the most virtuous of
      heroines, and children who eventually defeat those big bad grown-ups. In this
      book, Matilda isn't just smart, she is ``extra-ordinary. . .sensitive and brilliant,''
      reading Great Expectations as a four year old. Unfortunately, her TV-addict
      parents neither recognize nor appreciate their daughter's genius. Neglected
      Matilda finds mentors in librarian Mrs. Phelps and teacher Miss Honey, a woman
      as sweet as her name implies. Miss Honey, Matilda, and other students are tormented
      by the child-hating headmistress Trunchbull. Trunchbull has also cheated orphaned
      niece Miss Honey out of her rightful inheritance, leaving the teacher in extreme
      poverty. Having practiced revenge techniques on her father, Matilda now applies
      her untapped mental powers to rid the school of Trunchbull and restore Miss
      Honey's financial security. If the conclusion is a bit too rapid, the transitions
      between Matilda's home and school life a bit choppy, and the writing style not
      as even as in some of Dahl's earlier titles, young readers won't mind. Dahl
      has written another fun and funny book with a child's perspective on an adult
      world. As usual, Blake's comical sketches are the perfect complement to the
      satirical humor. This may not be a teacher's or principal's first choice as
      a classroom read-aloud, but children will be waiting in line to read it.

      (fear of being eaten)—and many others. The phobias are illustrated with mixed-media

      examines two fears, giving the Latin name, definition, and icon in the upper

      quite satisfied with his life just as it is, but he soon finds himself ensconced
      in a spooky, creaky tower bedroom in Helton Hall, under the care of his two

      next in line to inherit the family mansion if something should happen to Oliver,

      Hi Shalini,


      Looking fwd to receiving the books. Cant express in words how much your books
      have helped my son''s imagination and vocabulary. His teacher says his friends
      pick up new words from him. :)))


      Warm Regards,

      Vanaja'

    - Karin Levi’s world of family, school, and friends is torn apart when the German
      army occupies Paris in June of 1940. Karin and her brother, Marc, like Jews
      all over Europe, find themselves on the run, seeking safety wherever they can
      find it. When Marc obtains two coveted places aboard a ship bound for the United
      States, Karin knows that crossing the ocean means she may never see her beloved
      parents again. Yet she and Marc have little choice if they are to survive. Karin’s
      unforgettable story--revealing the little-known world of a handful of European
      refugees in World War II America--tells of survival, of growing up, and of love’s
      ability to endure even the most extraordinary circumstances.

    - ! "Half moorfolk and half human, and unable to shape-shift or disappear at will,
      Moql threatens the safety of the Band. So the Folk banish her and send her to
      live among humans as a changeling. Named Saaski by the couple for whose real
      baby she was swapped, she grows up taunted and feared by the villagers for being
      different, and is comfortable only on the moor, playing strange music on her
      bagpipes.\r\nAs Saaski grows up, memories from her forgotten past with the Folks
      slowly emerge. But so do emotions from her human side, and she begins to realize
      the terrible wrong the Folk have done to the humans she calls Da and Mumma.
      She is determined to restore their child to them, even if it means a dangerous
      return to the world that has already rejected her once."

    - Twelve-year-old Hollis Woods has been through many foster homes--and she runs
      away, every time. In her latest placement, with an artist named Josie, the tightly

      Hollis' own drawings, always her voice and the way she sees best, proliferate.
      In flashback and memory, we see Hollis' last foster family, what they meant
      to her, and why she ran. But Josie is slowly slipping into dementia, and Hollis
      knows that she'll be taken away from her if Josie is found out. How she saves
      Josie and herself is the kernel of this moving story about families, longing,
      and belonging.  - Booklist

      eager to go and fight on the side of the North. One night a mysterious girl
      arrives on a steamboat bound for St. Louis. Delphine is unlike anyone the small
      river town has even seen. Mrs. Pruitt agrees to take Delphine and her dark,
      silent traveling companion in as boarders. No one in town knows what to make
      of the two strangers, and so the rumors fly. Is Delphine's companion a slave?
      Could they be spies for the South? Are the Pruitts traitors? A masterful tale
      of mystery and war, and a breathtaking portrait of the lifelong impact one person
      can have on another.- Connie Tyrrell Burns

    - Greta had always loved the fog—the soft gray mist that rolled in from the sea
      and drifted over the village. The fog seemed to have a secret to tell her. Then
      one day when Greta was walking in the woods and the mist was closing in, she
      saw the dark outline of a stone house against the spruce trees—a house where
      only an old cellar hole should have been. Then she saw a surrey come by, carrying
      a lady dressed in plum- colored silk. The woman beckoned for Greta to join her,
      and soon Greta found herself launched on an adventure that would take her back
      to a past that existed only through the magic of the fog.

      it is painful to try to imagine what the world would be like without them. The
      perfect book for that all-important birthday, Now We Are Six is much more than
      a worthy successor to When We Were Very Young; it is a modern classic in its
      own right. The beguiling verses are rendered more delightful by E.H. Shepard's
      enchanting pictures.

    - First published in 1908, Kenneth Grahame's 'The Wind in the Willows' is one
      of the great stories of childhood. The adventures of Ratty, Mole and the wayward
      Toad never fail to delight – and everyone knows that there's nothing better
      than simply messing about in boats. Inga Moore's sensitive abridgement remains
      true to the spirit of the story – a classic work of literature that is both
      beautiful and very funny.

    - The words are basic and effective; it's the detailed watercolors of the animals
      that are the real attraction here. In precise brushstrokes and vivid colors,
      Brett creates incredibly textured feathers and fur, and the appealing book design
      positions the images on backgrounds made to resemble papyrus scrolls. Very young
      children will want to point out their favorite animals in the parade; older
      ones who know the story may enjoy this kinder, secular version.

    - This novel for young readers is delightfully droll, even as it deals with the
      difficult theme of social classes and pits the rich against the poor. It is
      set in post-World War II Canada, providing an interesting historic context,
      and as always Doyle's realistic dialogue and teen-oriented situations appeal
      to this age group.

      made, the mittens his daughter knitted, and the linen they wove. He packs the
      birch brooms his son carved, and even a bag of goose feathers from the barnyard
      geese. He travels over hills, through valleys, by streams, past farms and villages.
      At Portsmouth Market he sells his goods, one by one - even his beloved ox. Then,
      with his pockets full of coins, he wanders through the market, buying provisions
      for his family, and returns to his home. And the cycle begins again.

    - ! 'Tomie dePaola serves as "biographer" to his delightful Italian sorceress,
      Strega Nona, in this beautifully drawn prequel. The tale begins with little
      Nona''s birth on a dark and stormy night, and ends where the original Strega
      Nona picks up-with Strega Nona taking on the bumbling, knock-kneed Big Anthony
      as an apprentice. This winsome story is illustrated throughout with Tomie dePaola''s
      warm and sunny watercolors! '

      visit, she brings more than just gossip. Soon she's set up her own shop, using

    - On a cold windy night, an itty-bitty mouse "pitter-pat, tip-toe, creep-crawls"
      into a sleeping bear's cozy lair, looking for relief from the bitter winter
      weather. Soon he is joined by a veritable menagerie of woodland animals, and
      the party begins. Popping corn, brewing tea, tweeting, and chatting, the critters
      enjoy themselves thoroughly while the bear slumbers through it all. Until, that
      is, an errant pepper flake from the simmering stew wakes him up with a giant
      sneeze...

    - The busy Boston streets are too dangerous for eight little ducklings! But with
      a little help from a friendly policeman Mrs. Mallard and her family arrive safely
      at their new home. The public garden was no place for ducklings when they were
      first born, but now they are old enough to brave the raucous crowds and swim
      with the giant swan boats. This old Caldecott winning classic continues to delight
      generations of children.

    - A white-bearded farmer lives the simple life with a few animals that he names
      One through Five. Children don't find out which number matches which animal,
      though, until they follow the farmer through a visually clever dream. "It's
      almost Christmas, and it hasn't snowed yet," says the farmer. But as he sleeps,
      he envisions snow falling, covering each of his animals, while the text counts
      along--"The snowflakes gently covered One with a blanket"---a plastic sheet
      printed with snow overlays each page, concealing the collage images until readers
      lift the page and discover that One is a horse, Two is a cow, etc. Dream becomes
      reality when the farmer awakes to a white world and hurries outside (dressed
      in Santa coat and boots) with presents for the animals and ornaments for a tree
      that, thanks to a changeable battery pack, plays a chiming tune at the press
      of a button.

      barefoot and running, she can hear her heart beating . . . thump-THUMP, thump-THUMP.
      It's a rhythm that makes sense in a year when everything's shifting: Her mother
      is pregnant, her grandfather is forgetful, and her best friend, Max, is always
      moody. Everything changes over time, just like the apple Annie's been assigned
      to draw. But as she watches and listens, Annie begins to understand the many
      rhythms of life, and how she fits within them."

    - Duck is not happy with his lot on Farmer Brown's farm, so he calls an election...and
      wins. But he soon finds out that he doesn't actually enjoy running a farm and
      that he'd much rather hit the campaign trail. Moving higher and higher up the
      political hierarchy, Duck ultimately finds himself running the country. But
      is he happy? No, he yearns for the quiet life and so answers an add in the paper..."Duck
      wanted, no experience necessary". An entertaining and original tale that takes
      a whole new look at the corridors of power!

      by A.A. Milne and features Pooh and his friends. The large, clear type and well-loved,
      colourful illustrations will have instant appeal for the younger reader. In
      this story, Pooh makes up a simple game ("Poohsticks") which involves dropping
      sticks into the water on one side of a bridge, and guessing which will emerge
      first on the other side. As with most of the Pooh stories, the ostensible plot-in
      this case, Pooh making up a game-naturally morphs into a lazily wandering adventure
      featuring Eeyore, Piglet, Rabbit and the other Hundred-Acre Wood inhabitants. '

      assistant, Mrs. De Soto, he copes with the toothaches of animals large and small.
      His expertise is so great that his fortunate patients never feel any pain. Since
      he’s a mouse, Doctor De Soto refuses to treat “dangerous” animals—that is, animals
      who have a taste for mice. But one day a fox shows up and begs for relief from
      the tooth that's killing him. How can the kindhearted De Sotos turn him away?
      But how can they make sure that the fox doesn’t give in to his baser instincts
      once his tooth is fixed? Those clever De Sotos will find a way.\r\n"

      millions of readers have been caputured by the story of Peter, Susan, Edmund
      and Lucy, who step through a magic wardrobe into Narnia, once the peaceful land
      of Talking Beasts, dwarfs, giants and fauns, but now frozen into eternal winter
      by the evil White Witch. Second in the series chronologically.

    - ! '"''Ah!'' said the weasel. ''I am going to make mouse soup.'' ''Oh!'' said
      the mouse. ''I am going to be mouse soup.''" But wait - "Mouse soup must be
      mixed with stories to make it taste really good," he announces from the pot.
      And so, looking so absurdly endearing that you know he must be spared, the mouse
      tells the gullible weasel four stories. In the first a mouse outsmarts some
      bees, just as our mouse will outsmart his captor in the end; the other tales
      are, in turn, a simple fable, a laughable instance of misunderstanding, and
      a fondly amusing correlative of good will. Small but satisfying, and all informed
      with Lobel''s own gentle resonance.–Kirkus'

      illustrations have an even stronger effect than the words. Accomplished in a

    - A lighthearted, clever story presented in an oversize, colorful package. A bright
      blue giant squid cruises through the ocean, proudly noting that he is bigger
      than all the creatures he encounters. From shrimp to shark, he repeats his refrain,
      I'm bigger than…, sounding remarkably similar to a three-year-old cheerfully
      cataloging his world. Briefly dismayed when swallowed by a voracious whale (who
      has also swallowed up everyone else whole including the shark), the squid rallies
      by noting, I'm the biggest thing in this whale! This buoyant tale, filled with
      nonthreatening cartoonish denizens of the deep blue (and turquoise and green)
      sea, makes no effort to be realistic or educational but just simple fun, which
      is its charm. (Note the squid on the back cover proudly stating that he is bigger
      than the bar code.)

    - Matilda is a little girl who is far too good to be true. At age five-and-a-half
      she's knocking off double-digit multiplication problems and blitz-reading Dickens.

      and the teacher's pet. But everything is not perfect in Matilda's world. For
      starters she has two of the most idiotic, self-centered parents who ever lived.
      Then there's the large, busty nightmare of a school principal, Mrs. ("The")
      Trunchbull.
