<h3>Condition of used books</h3>

<p>We like working with used books for many reasons: the excitement of discovery,
finding unusual and rare books, and because it is wonderful to be able to reuse
things and pass loved possessions on.</p>

<p>However we are careful to see that every book we pick up is in readable
condition, with no pages missing. In the rare case that there is an oversight,
we are happy to exchange or take back the book.</p>

<p>Books are classified on the basis of their condition:</p>

<p><strong>Like New</strong> <span  class="rating"><%= render "shared/rating", :rating => 5, :no => true %></span>

<p>These are excellent copies that are good enough to be gifted, bearing no pen marks or stains of any sort.</p>

<p><strong>Excellent</strong> <span  class="rating"><%= render "shared/rating", :rating => 4, :no => true %></span></p>

<p>These copies have no major creases, stains, tears or dog-eared pages, but may
be very mildly creased or marked. Their condition is otherwise excellent.</p>

<p><strong>Good</strong> <span class="rating"><%= render "shared/rating", :rating => 3, :no => true %></span></p>

<p>These have no major tears and are not very old or worn-out. But they may be
creased, stained or dog-eared. They are in good reading condition.</p>

<p><strong>Acceptable</strong> <span class="rating"><%= render "shared/rating", :rating => 2, :no => true %></span> <span class="and">and</span> <span class="rating"><%= render "shared/rating", :rating => 1, :no => true %></span></p>

<p>Copies classified as acceptable are damaged but readable. They may be old and
yellowing, or have torn pages (which do not get in the way of reading), and may
be heavily marked.</p>
