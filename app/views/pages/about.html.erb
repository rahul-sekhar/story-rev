<h3>Story Revolution</h3>

<p>Story Revolution is a children's literature project. The project springs from
the feeling that literature with depth, vitality and a timeless quality must be
brought to children from the very beginning. We are excited about the
possibility of reading, as any other activity, being driven by love and wonder
instead of being drudgery, or converted into popcorn-like entertainment to be
consumed. </p>

<p>Most of all, for us, this project comes from our own love for the words,
illustrations and stories in these books and a desire to share them.</p>

<p>What we have right now is a specially curated selection of used and new books
for young people of all ages. At the moment we have no physical bookstore: we
sell these books online and sometimes hold book sales.</p>

<h3>What we look for</h3>

<p>We look for books written and illustrated with a sense of joy and passion, and
  with an understanding of the mind of the child. These books open children's
  minds, nurturing curiosity, empathy, compassion and an understanding of
  themselves and of the world. They are books a child can love over and over
  again.</p>

<p>We look for excellence in writing and illustration, and tend to pick books
that have won international awards. These books are sometimes well-known
classics, but are often practically unknown here in India. </p>

<p>We have looked carefully and critically at books by Indian publishers as well
as publishers abroad. Our collection includes both, and we are always interested
in finding books that are from unusual contexts but have universal
relevance.</p>

<p>Adults usually enjoy these books as much as children.</p>
